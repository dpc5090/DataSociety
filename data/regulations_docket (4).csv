Dear Administrator Pruitt and Acting Region 10 Administrator Pirzadeh:
I am writing today to urge the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to keep the 404(c) Proposed Determination in place protect Bristol Bay, Alaska, from the proposed Pebble Mine that would threaten the region's irreplaceable fish and wildlife resources and the 14,000 jobs that depend on Bristol Bay's clean, healthy waters.
According to the EPA's own study:
 The Bristol Bay watershed provides vital habitat for 29 fish species, more than 190 bird species, and more than 40 terrestrial animals. All five species of Pacific salmonsockeye, Chinook, coho, chum and pinkspawn and rear in the pristine Bristol Bay watershed.
 The Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, producing approximately 46% of the world's wild sockeye harvest, creating $1.5 billion in economic output and nearly 20,000 jobs throughout the United States annually.
 Construction of the Pebble deposit will destroy 94 miles of salmon streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, lakes and ponds.
Mining the headwaters of the Bristol Bay river systems could cause irreparable harm to the valuable Bristol Bay fishery, wildlife, and people, and that's just in its construction and use, not even considering an accident which could have a disastrous impact in this pristine environment.
This area holds great ecological and economic value. I recommend the EPA keep in place the 404(c) Proposed Determination for Bristol Bay, Southwest Alaska. The restrictions included in that proposal and reasonable and will prevent unsustainable development that would adversely impact the region's fishery, recreation and local culture.
Please keep the agency's 404(c) action in place to protect one of the nation's greatest sustainable resourcesthe Bristol Bay, Alaska, salmon fishery.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

It is teaming with fish that locals depend upon for subsistence. Alaska Natives have been fishing those waters for centuries.  Pebble Mine will destroy it all.  The world's copper needs can be easily met by mining copper from many, many places around the world that are much safer and more practical.
The EPA itself has accidently released toxic water stored at a mine into drinking water systems.  What is to prevent that here?  There is no safe form of mining.  Just like any other mining that takes place, Pebble mining can have a severe effect on the surrounding environment. Due to this fact, Pebble mining does not have a great reputation among those who are advocates for protecting the environment. There are a number of emissions risks involved that can damage the quality of life for humans and animals in the region where the mining takes place. The terrain that is mined experiences damages and so does the ecosystem of the area. Vegetation and tree life is placed at risk and water supplies where the mining is conducted are often unusable afterwards, thanks to toxic runoff. The soil's natural condition is also in jeopardy and it can become impossible to grow crops after the Pebble mine project has concluded. 
Since pebble mining is a fairly new development, very little research has been done regarding the long term effects. As such, we know an astonishingly small amount about the damage that will be caused to fault lines in the area and what will need to be done in order to combat this sort of effect. Until the proper research can be conducted, pebble mining could prove to be extremely problematic.  When so little is known about the long term effects as it relates to earthquakes, this places workers at greater risk of suffering injuries or fatalities. Even though mine workers are very well compensated for their time, a high salary is not always an acceptable substitute for safety. 
When a depressed economic area decides to become a mining region, this can attract the wrong type of element.  People who live near mines often report troubling activities that take place in adjacent areas, as transients and criminals will typically take advantage of the sudden influx of income in the region where the mining is being conducted.  Instances of crimes tend to be more pronounced in places where mining has recently begun. Theft, drug sales, drug addiction and sex based crimes are all more common and local residents who are against the commencement of mining often cite the horror stories of other mining based economies as a means of frightening away this particular economic stimulant. 
There are a large number of chemicals that are involved with the creation of any mining project. These toxic chemicals end up accumulating over the course of time and causing a number of issues for the local population, as well as plants and animals that have become accustomed to living in the region. The worst part of all? Scientists do not have the full scope of what these toxic chemicals are capable of.  Mining projects have a way of going awry when least expected, which can cause toxic waste to spread uncontrollably. Mercury and cyanide are often used, which can contaminate the environment and also pollute adjacent bodies of water. This has an extremely devastating overall effect on marine life, one that can take several generations to reverse.

Please put American jobs over mining interests and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.
 
Bristol Bay, Alaska is one of our last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a Canadian mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine. Although Alaskans typically support resource development, more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents oppose the proposed Pebble Mine. If built, the Pebble Mine would be many times larger than America's current largest open-pit mine and require several large earthen dams to hold back billions of tons of mine waste. This waste would require perpetual remediation and be forever at the headwaters of two of the most productive salmon rivers in the world.

In 2010, frustrated with ineffective and inadequate options for addressing the proposed mine at the local level, Alaska Native Tribes, commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize local communities, American jobs, and the region's thriving economy and culture.

The EPA responded by hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. After years of review and input from Americans, the EPA determined that a large mine of the type and scale contemplated by Pebble would have unacceptable adverse effects on the fish, recreation, and communities in the area, and based on this information proposed several restrictions that any mining in the Pebble area would have to meet.

Over the course of the EPA's own comment and public review processes, the EPA received more than 1.5 million comments asking for strong protections for Bristol Bay. Withdrawing the proposed determination would fly in the face of an overwhelming majority of Alaskans and put the short-term interests of a Canadian mining company above thousands of American jobs.  

Alaskans asked for state-level protections as well as the EPA's involvement and for up-front protections for Bristol Bay's jobs and fisheries. Please do not trade American businesses and jobs and our wild salmon for the shallow promises of a mining company. I am writing today to ask that you stand with American jobs and communities and not withdraw the Proposed Determination.

Using any reasonably pristine area to dump anything, especially anything having to do with mining,""...as disposal sites for dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit, a copper-, gold-, and molybdenum-bearing ore body"" is nothing but pandering to the almighty corporate dollar.  The only reason this has come up is to make the mining job CHEAPER for a corporation that is too lazy to think of anything else.  These companies don't pay enough taxes to clean up the mess they will surely make, nor do they care about the areas they assume they will be allowed to despoil. 

The salmon runs that will inevitably suffer and disappear means there will, obviously, be lost jobs and lives and communities  as an ""unintended"" consequence of this corporate grasping.  Individual fishermen and their families, the food chain, and the general population are apparently not considerations. And, again, those pesky salmon runs that will inevitably disappear

It proposed restrictions under the Clean Water Act that would have limited the size and impact of the potential Pebble Mine.

On July 11, 2017, in an abrupt about-face, the EPA is seeking to withdraw these suggested protections to clear the path for the development of large-scale mining on state and federal lands. The Pebble deposit threatens Bristol Bay being located at the headwaters of two of the eight major rivers that feed Bristol Bay - it would be the largest mine in Morth America and any release of the acidic waste generated from this mining operation (as has been shown in other areas with pit mining - Arizona near Tucson for example where I have lived), could be catastrophic (the 2014 Mount Polley Mine disaster in Canada shows even the most technologically advanced mine can fail - just like pipelines and nuclear power plants and other industrial projects we were told could not fail) .

For years, commercial fishermen and women, tribes, sportsmen and women, tourism operators, chefs, and Bristol Bay's business owners have fought against this proposed mining development. Bristol Bay's salmon are integral to food security worldwide and critical locally, where subsistence accounts for an average of 80 percent of the protein area residents consume, and salmon make up over half of the subsistence harvest. I can choose a different dinner but in Bristol Bay, salmon is life.

This salmon industry generates more than $1.5 billion in economic activity annually and it supports 14,000 jobs in Bristol Bay alone. Fishing provides more jobs and state revenue in Alaska than mining. The economic benefits are felt along the entire West Coast, especially in Washington. The Pebble Mine would jeopardize this thriving fish-based economy along with the fish that feed millions.  The mine is a short term benefit for the few.  Salmon are a long term benefit for the many.  We MUST stop opting for the short term gains at the expense of long term survival of humans and the rest of the animal world (yes, we too are animals).

In the response to the proposed rule change that protects Bristol Bay, I would like to highly encourage the EPA to maintain the current rule. Bristol Bay is a vital watershed that makes up the breeding grounds for millions of salmon. These salmon are a vital part of the food chain in the Pacific Northwest, not only for the local marine wildlife but also for humans. There are 14,000 jobs in the Bristol Bay Area alone that are dependent on the these salmon which are part of a $1.5 billion industry. In 2014 the EPA found this area to be so fragile that building mines on the rivers that feed into Bristol Bay would likely destroy this habitat for salmon. That has not changed. The EPA needs to say NO to the Pebble Mine and protect this beautiful area. As a native to the Pacific Northwest, I can tell you that we pride ourselves in the protection of our environment, the love of our salmon, and our beautiful waterways. We care more about investing in the long term future than making short term profits as the Pebble Mine would.

I just read an article about recent regulatory easing of protections put in place that protect the Bristol Bay watershed and its worldwide acclaim as the largest sockeye salmon run in the world.  As a nation we need to protect our assets and not allow corporations outside our country to develop a business on our nation's land to increase their own outside profit.  Profit that will stay outside our country at the expense and risk of a long held asset that is American made and American run.  
It is up to the Environmental Protection Agency to protect our country's assets and not open the door for others to make money off our land.  The Pebble Mine in Bristol Bay is perilous to the American fishing industry that has been on those lands since the start of our republic.

This past July 11, in an abrupt about-face under a new administration, the EPA proposed to withdraw its previously proposed Clean Water Act protections in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed, and to clear the path for the development of large-scale mining on state and federal lands-- including the Pebble Mine. The Pebble depositwith massive deposits of gold, copper, and molybdenumis in the headwaters of two of the eight major rivers that feed Bristol Bay. If built, it would be the largest open-pit mine in North America. Any release of the acidic waste generated from mining into surface or groundwater could be catastrophic. Contamination of surrounding watershed is pretty much guaranteed with any hard rock mine, but how much is always the question. The 2014 Mount Polley Mine disaster in Canada provides a cautionary tale that even the most technologically advanced mine can fail.

Bristol Bay supports the largest wild sockeye salmon fishery in the world, with approximately 46% of the average global abundance. Picture an average of 40 million red sockeye salmon returning annually from their years at sea to spawn in cold and crystal-clear streams of Bristol Bay. Now picture an enormous open pit mine situated directly atop these crucial headwaters. 

For years, residents of Bristol Bay have successfully fought against this proposed developmentincluding commercial fishermen and women, tribes, sportsmen and women, and local businesses including recreation and tourism. Bristol Bay's salmon are integral to food security worldwide, and they are a critical local food source. In the Bristol Bay region, subsistence accounts for an average of 80% of protein consumed by area residents, and salmon make up just over half of the subsistence harvest. 

Let's be clear, we're not choosing between profits and no profits. If we protect Bristol Bay we can have jobs and a clean environment, year after year. This salmon industry generates more than $1.5 billion in economic activity annually and it supports 14,000 jobs in Bristol Bay alone. Overall, fishing provides more jobs and state revenue in Alaska than mining. The economic benefits are also felt through-out the west coast, especially in Washington state, my home statefrom jobs in catching and processing fish to supplies and services. The Pebble Mine would jeopardize this thriving fish-based economy; revenue, jobs, and the fish that feed millions. The Pebble Mine prospect is the wrong mine in the wrong place. Mining in this watershed is unconscionable. Please live up to your name.

Even without a mine disaster, construction of the Pebble deposit will destroy 94 miles of salmon streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, lakes and ponds. Overall, EPA concluded that mining the headwaters of the Bristol Bay river systems could cause irreparable harm to the valuable Bristol Bay fishery, wildlife, and people.
According to the EPA's own study, the Bristol Bay watershed provides vital habitat for 29 fish species, more than 190 bird species, and more than 40 terrestrial animals.

Failure of containment is inevitable - just as earthquakes in that region are inevitable.  Contamination of the headwaters will contaminate critical spawning and rearing reaches for several species of salmon, especially sockeye.  Bristol Bay fisheries provide high quality protein to millions of people a year as well as the Native Americans for whom these fish are both a birthright and a treaty right.  Tens of thousands of  people make decent wages fishing Bristol Bay and providing support for the fishing industry.  The fishing industry that feeds millions of people can go on forever if the headwaters are not polluted.  Salmon resources in the lower 48 continue to dwindle from human impacts.  

Perhaps the mining company owns the mineral rights.  Clean water and prime habitat are public resources just as the fish who are owned in common by this great country - America.  

There is no great shortage for our society of gold, copper and molybdenum.   Market prices show that.  Reversing this decision and enabling the mine to move forward makes profit for the shareholders including many foreigners and gives jobs to several hundred people at most - and for only as long as removing the minerals makes economic sense.  

Trading food security for millions and jobs for tens of thousands forever for the short-term profit of a few is immoral, unscientific  and opposite of making America great.  Please reject the reconsideration and maintain the environmental integrity of the entire Bristol Bay watershed.

Do not withdraw protections on mining at Bristol Bay. The July 11, 2017 EPA seeking to do so is a classic case of freedom to versus freedom from in policy making. The critical question is whether greed for gold, copper and other minerals by those that advocate freedom to has greater long term direct and indirect benefits than long term protection of the pristine ecosystem. The benefits of mining are less because they are not essential to our lives and wellbeing in the short, medium or long term. The food, lives, and jobs are higher value from any standpoint.

I am a biologist and resident of the Pacific Northwest. 

1. Northern Dynasty is not financially viable, as reported by a New York investment firm's analysis:

""Northern Dynasty's key asset, the lowgrade Pebble deposit, is not commercially viable: mining it would require so much upfront investment that it would actually destroy value. 
Kerrisdale believes Northern Dynasty's former partners concluded that the Pebble project had a negative present value - an assessment that Northern Dynasty has spent years trying to conceal from the public.
Not only that, but a law firm has announced an investigation into possible securities fraud violations. 

In contrast, the value of the Bristol Bay fishery is proven. Every year, millions upon millions of wild salmon return to Bristol Bay, like no place else on earth. It's the economic backbone of the region, supplying roughly half of the world's supply of wild sockeye salmon, and generating $1.5 billion in annual value. It can continue to play this vital role as long as the habitat is protected.""  (1)

2. The proposed mine imperils the world's largest salmon run.  ""A three-year Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study in 2014 found that the proposed mine would destroy 24 to 94 miles of salmon-producing waterways in the course of normal, safe mine operations. The University of Alaska Institute of Social and Economic Research found that the Bristol Bay, the fishery affected by the mine, supports 22,000 jobs and adds $674 million of economic activity to the states of Washington, Oregon, and California. Further, restrictions on mining have the support of 90% of local residents."" (2) 

Allowing development of the Pebble Mine puts short-term corporate profits ahead of the wishes of local residents, local jobs, a crucial regional food source, and environmental health.

Mr. Scott Pruitt, Administrator 
Ms. Michelle Pirzadeh, Acting Regional Administrator, Region 10
US Environmental Protection Agency

Subject: Docket ID No. EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369; Pebble Mine

Dear Mr. Pruitt and Ms. Pirzadeh:
I am writing to express my most deeply held convictions that the US EPA' efforts to withdraw the 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination made in this matter of the Pebble Mine are wrong and contrary to the goals and objectives of the Clean Water Act.

I have worked in Alaskas as a naturalist dating back to the mid-1980's. I was a wetland scientist and worked for US EPA for 27 years. I have received an award for ""outstanding accomplishments in the protection and wise stewardship of the national wetlands resources."" While I have never worked on the Pebble Mine project, I am very familiar with the CWA Section 404 (b)(1) Guidelines and federal and state agency processes for evaluating such proposals. 

When Congress enacted the Clean Water protections, the first substantive paragraph states the ""objective of this chapter is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters."" If ever there were a watershed of such national and even international importance, it would be this project's watershed. If ever the 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines) were put in place to protect an important aquatic resource, it would be for a proposed action of this magnitude in a location such as this. It is stunningly beautiful and pristine; supports numerous fish, mammal and bird species; is highly valued of of economic importance to the native Tribes of Alaska; and is equally treasured by sportsmen and those who enjoy the out-of-doors for intrinsic, non-extractive values.

As a remarkable show of public opposition to this project, the Alaska Bristol Bay Mining Ban Question, Ballot Measure 4, was on the November 4, 2014 ballot in Alaska as an initiated state statute, where it was approved by a stunning 66% margin. Additionally, hundreds of fishing, hunting, and recreational groups opposed the project. You should need to know nothing more than this to maintain the Proposed Determination. It would be a reflection of good government process and obviate the need for a protracted 404 permit review process which, if legitimate, should end in permit denial by the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). 

In my view, there are not sufficient grounds for approving this project, given the criteria provided in the Guidelines in light of the difficulty approving an extractive industrial site with its attendant risks of toxic chemical and sediment releases - to speak not of indirect effects - in a watershed that supports natural resources of the magnitude documented in the 2014 Bristol Bay Assessment. Even if that threshold could be rationalized through a tortured 404 permit process, there would remain the requirement of finding appropriate and complete compensatory mitigation under the 2008 Mitigation Rule. An example of how difficult this mitigation requirement would be comes from the Bristol Bay Assessment, which states that under the three development scenarios analyzed, there would be between 9-33 linear miles of streams that would be impacted. Stream mitigation is difficult at best and impossible in many circumstances. Just how would the project proponents meet this one requirement? And this is just one criterion, among many, that makes this project a candidate for denial.

Furthermore, the press release states ""EPA may use its scientific assessment regarding the Bristol Bay Watershed without limitation."" If EPA or the Corps were to use the findings in the scientific assessment (which have not changed since publication), surely there would be grounds for upholding the Proposed Determination or, if a permit action were to evaluated by the Corps, a denial. How can the Agency justify revoking the Proposed Determination if the underlying science remains unchanged? That appears arbitrary and capricious. What is the factual basis for making this significant change of proposing to withdraw the Proposed Determination that has, as its scientific underpinnings, the 2014 Bristol Bay Assessment? This implies that the Agency (or the Corps) will not rely on this existing science to make its regulatory decisions. This is blatantly contrary to the requirements of evaluation of 404 permit applications under the Guidelines. 

I urge you to uphold the Proposed Determination. The strong public opposition to the project, in combination with sound watershed science that underscores the justification for protecting this aquatic resource of national importance, are your grounds for denying this ill-conceived project. 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Secretary Ross,
Please protect the Marine Sanctuaries and do not let them be exploited by short sighted, short term interests. In 1975, the first national marine sanctuaries were designated under the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972. Florida's Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary was the first. After years of overfishing and pollution the reef was dying, threatening the fishing industry, tourism, land value and other economic interests. A healthy reef ecosystem was key to a both a thriving economy and a healthy marine environment in that area. The office of the National Marine Sanctuary Southeast region now includes three distinctive yet interconnected healthy reef systems, Gray's Reef, Florida Keys and Flower Garden Banks national marine sanctuaries. The protection was an excellent long term investment in the regional economy and now many businesses and commercial properties thrive there.

All of our National Marine sanctuaries are protecting important natural resources that serve millions of people in the Northeast, West and beyond. In Bodega Bay for the first time in many years fisherman are experiencing a welcome resurgence of the crab industry. Last summer I had the opportunity to visit Monterey Bay where whales were seen in record numbers feeding on abundant runs of anchovies. Millions are flocking each year to visit these sanctuaries providing billions of dollars for the small business tourist industry as well as commercial operations. Your vote to protect these sanctuaries now will make an enduring difference for many future generations of Americans. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Christine Holmes",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

It makes no sense to go back and fish for another conclusion to an already carefully researched question.  The Pebble Mine poses a terrible risk to a vast, unspoiled, and critical watershed.  The risk also applies to the fishing industry in Alaska, and fishing generates more jobs and revenue in Alaska than mining. [""The peril of mining the pristine headwaters of Alaska's Bristol Bay"", Helen Cherullo in The Seattle Times, July 22, 2017]. The salmon bred in that watershed provides food security for the area residents as well as economic footing for related jobs up and down the west coast and around the world.

Caving into the pressure of the mining industry is morally indefensible.  Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote, ""In Bristol Bay, we must take the long view.  We must expand our concept of wealth, counting the riches of food for the community to be just as important, if not more import, than profits to shareholders.""  We all have a share in a gift that cannot be remade if spoiled, and spoiling that treasured space is a matter of ""when"" and not ""if"" after a huge mine is installed in its headwaters.

Having salmon fished in this pristine area for many years, I feel the EPA should be doing more to protect this area and less to lower the environmental standards so that mining can take place here.    The Pebble Mine is not a good fit for this area, and many others feel the same way.

The economic impact derived from the salmon industry in Bristol Bay is estimate at $1.5 BILLION annually.  Additionally, there are over 14,000 jobs in Bristol Bay alone associated with the salmon industry.  Finally, the EPA must consider the residence of the area who for them salmon is not just part of their job, but also their part of their food security.  

Lowering environmental standards so that the Pebble Mine can access this legendary area is a significant mistake.  Long after the mining industry is finished their work  the detrimental effects of their mining practices will linger.

STOP the mine before it starts, save the salmon, the fisheries and communities that have and will need this precious area and it's fishing resources  for generations.

In 2010, Bristol Bay's tribes, joined by Native corporations, commercial fishermen, the sports and recreation industry, and other supporters petitioned the EPA to protect Bristol Bay from the risks posed by the Pebble minerisks to salmon, waterways, people, and the economy. The EPA responded by undertaking a multi-year, peer-reviewed scientific study that was subject to extensive public participation. As a result, the EPA proposed common sense protections for the Bristol Bay watershed supported by millions of Americans. The EPA should not now undermine the work that has been done.

Large-scale industrial mining doesn't belong at the headwaters of our country's greatest salmon fishery. If we lose Bristol Bay to mining, we will lose a piece of ourselves, and a critical part of Alaska's culture and economy. 

I am opposed to the EPA making a deal with a foreign mining company when Alaskansi.e., Americansoppose this mine. Pebble wants to build an open pit mine near some of Alaska's and our nation's most precious waters. They are not looking after our state's health or that of our fish, cultures, livelihoods and way of life. What's at risk is the last great sockeye salmon fishery in Alaska and the country. For us, that means losing everything. 

It is the EPA's job to protect our environment, not put the financial interests of an outside mining company over protecting Bristol Bay. Our fish provide long-term jobs to Alaskans. More than 60% of Alaskans and 80% of Bristol Bay residents want Bristol Bay protected.  

Compromising Bristol Bay for a mine is unacceptable. The EPA previously recognized the threat of the mine to the area when proposing scientifically backed protections for the Bristol Bay watershed. Do not withdraw those proposed protections.

Thank you.

The Bristol Bay watershed is much too valuable to the American economy and to small Alaskan communities to recklessly endanger it by allowing the permits for Pebble Mine to move forward. If this Administration is indeed in favor of strong U.S. jobs, then choose the 14,000 fishing jobs this fishery supports year after year. If the Administration indeed values small, rural communities, consider the dozens of villages and towns reliant on this income, and on Bristol Bay salmon as a subsistence food source. If this Administration thinks a healthy environment, clean water, and wildlife are worth protecting, then the only course of action is to maintain your 2015 proposed determination and prevent these permits from moving forward. This exact situation is why Section 404c of the CWA exists. Any claims that a mining project of this scale and Bristol Bay's incredibly productive fishery can ""happily coexist"" is completely delusional at best, and criminally negligent at worst. The people of this country have seen strikingly similar tailings dams fail time and time again - particularly the recent failure at the Mount Polley Mine in Canada that dumped millions of gallons of toxic slurry into the Fraser River system. We know these failures are not a question of ""if"" but ""when"", especially in such a seismically active area. Storing billions of tons of toxic waste ""in perpetuity"" virtually guarantees that it will fail and devastate the salmon fishery at some point in the future -- likely when this partnership of companies have dissolved/disappeared and current EPA employees are long gone. But make no mistake: for the current EPA to move forward with the Pebble permitting process is to admit you're comfortable putting the short-term interests of foreign corporations ahead of long-term jobs, food security, and natural resources for Americans - period. Please do your job - and the right thing - by maintaining your 2015 proposed determination, and prevent the permitting of Pebble. We're counting on you to take this decision in a courageous and historic direction rather than presenting another bleak disappointment in the EPA's ability to fulfill its mandate of protecting the environment.

Our jobs, food and natural habitats should not be placed in danger due to politics as usual.

It proposed restrictions under the Clean Water Act that would have limited the size and impact of the potential Pebble Mine. Now the EPA is seeking to withdraw these suggested protections.

Bristol Bay supports the largest wild sockeye salmon fishery in the world. The EPA already determined that large scale mining is too risky in this area. Do not open this area up to mining. This kind of short term thinking is dangerous and threatens our Jobs as well as the environment. The Pebble deposit is in the headwaters of two of the eight major rivers that feed Bristol Bay.

There are many comments here stating some 'hypothetical' environmental damage to Bristol Bay. What I do no understand is, it is well known that the Veto that was in place by the EPA was unlawful and not based on an actual mine plan from PLP, it was a fictional plan, this is fact. 

The EPA's peer review stated that there was no factual science specific to the PLP that could lend itself to the findings. Yet, I see many here arguing that there will be some damage? Until a mine plan is provided, until the Army Corps of engineers review it, there is no proof of such damage. 

Moreover, the mine itself is only close to tributaries that could affect 2-3% of Bristol Bay and the company has stated they will have mitigation plans in place. In addition, the company has recently stated they will not even be utilizing cyanide leaching in their first phase. 

Alaska is broke, we need well paying jobs, and long term jobs. We have an enormous deficit, oil and gas can no longer sustain our economy and with the advent of electric cars that will only get worse over time. The fisheries will not be hurt, we will diversify our economy and help grow the tax base for all Alaskans materially. Not only that, copper is a much needed resource for the 'green economy'. 

Many people here are making environmental claims that are not based in fact or science, I do not understand this. Do you care about the environment or do you have another agenda? It makes no sense. You'd rather have Alaskan's starve so you can feel good about protecting the environment, when no damage will occur? So you're not really achieving anything other than preventing jobs and tax revenues for the state?

I for one think Science should decide, fact should decide, not baseless opinions based on reports that have been proven to be devoid of scientific fact. 

Mines can be built safely, let's stop with the environmental hyperbole and move into the 21st century. Alaska has one of the largest copper deposits in the world, it can help enrich the state in a world in desperate need of it for electronics, electric cars, infrastructure, wind turbines, etc.

Local communities have long been opposed to Pebble Mine. More than 65 percent of all Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents -- including Native people -- and more than 85 percent of commercial fisherman strongly oppose it.

And it's no secret why: the mine could generate 23 billion tons of dangerous waste, wipe out 90 miles of salmon streams and pollute more than 5,000 acres of wetlands, ponds and lakes. The salmon population would likely plummet -- with catastrophic impacts for the local communities.

By cancelling this provision, the EPA will blatantly give Northern Dynasty  (a foreign corporation) an unfair advantage in
securing permitting for its Pebble Mine Project.  

Pebble Mine is a threat to the spawning grounds of the most productive salmon producing region in the world.  If destroyed,
this will adversely effect Native Americans, American fishing interests as well as related U.S. businesses that depend on the
health of this region.

The EPA has an obligation to protect this irreplaceable watershed. Repealing this act is an ill advised, politically motivated 
decision that will ignore years of environmental research as well as the opposition of an overwhelming majority of Americans
and is a violation of the responsibility of the EPA.

One of these freedoms is the right to ""due process"" which is part of the fourth and fifth amendments of the Bill of Rights. The right of ""due process"" guarantees the safeguard from arbitrary denial by the Government outside the sanctions of law. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Northern Dynasty Minerals (NDM) entered into a legal dispute over EPA's 2014 Proposed Determination of which essentially removed NDM's right to ""due process"" under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Northern Dynasty Minerals won their right to due process in a settlement with the EPA in May 2017. The NEPA legislative process must be allowed its due course in permit application for NDM. 

In simplification of the permit process follows a brief outline for the layman reader. The US Army Corps of Engineers reviews all permit applications and accordingly provides the applicant an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The EIS outlines any and all impediments to the surrounding environment. The EIS stipulates compliance recommendations that must be adhered to, and failure of an applicant to provide satisfactory compliance mitigation(s) within their revised permit application plan thus results in denial of the permit. 

Northern Dynasty Minerals has repeated their commitment to work in concert with Environmental, Fisheries and Native Alaskan stakeholders. Allow Northern Dynasty Minerals the due process to prove their commitment.

It is more cost efficient for the salmon industry to hire foreigners than it is to establish sustainable fair wages and maintain legally standard working conditions for their own Alaskan community. 

The salmon industry is a highly profitable business. In fact it is amongst the highest profit making industries, however it is not an industry that pays fair wages nor does it provide sustainable gainful employment for the community. It would be nice to envision the old days of fishermen on their boats working hard for the days catch and bringing the bounty of the land for the community, but those days are long gone, unfortunately. 

So, please, enough with the war against one mining company when the salmon companies have no interest in providing your community with any consideration.

Forty-six percent of sockeye salmon in the world return each year to spawn in the cold and crystal clear streams that feed Bristol Bay.

In the Pacific Northwest we treasure our salmon and the streams and rivers that nourish them.  You can't have one without the other--clean streams and rivers plus a pristine salt water Bay is required for salmon to complete their journey to the ocean and eventual return to their ancestral breeding grounds.  

Though not a Native American by birth, I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington, and know the salmon life cycle and the sacred ground and water needed to sustain them.  Please review the 2014  input of 1.5 million people verifying that the Bristol Bay watershed is too fragile to tolerate the risks of large scale mining.

You can't eat gold, copper or molybdenum.  Yes some make money from the earth's riches, but Bristol Bay is worth more than money.  It provides a safe haven for the continuation of a sacred food chain that we can all partake in.

Please, no Pebble Mine.  Heed the words of Sandra Day O'Connor, ""We must take the long view.  We must expand our concept of wealth, counting riches of food for the community to be just as important, if not more important than profits to shareholders.""

The proposed determination should NOT be withdrawn for the following important reasons:

1.  The potential impacts of the proposed Pebble Mine on the health of the Bristol Bay watershed and the livelihood of thousands of people in Alaska are far too great to accept.

2.  The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world. It should be protected.

3.  The watershed is home to 25 federally recognized tribal governments who have maintained a salmon-based culture and subsistence-based way of life for at least 4,000 years that would be placed in jeopardy.

4.  The watershed's ecological resources generated nearly $480 million in direct economic expenditures and sales and provided employment for over 14,000 full- and part-time workers in 2009.  The Pebble Mine will jeopardize these significant economic opportunities.

5.  Contrary to the comments provided by the backers of the Pebble Mine project, EPA's watershed assessment was scientifically based and thoroughly peer-reviewed, and the public has had an extensive opportunity to comment on it. I reviewed part of it when I worked for the EPA.  The assessment and public comments received should be key components of any future action on this issue.

6.  The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the project. A statewide majority of voters also oppose it, as evidenced by the 2014 State-wide ballot measure.

7.  The rationale for the proposed withdrawal is flawed. Finalizing the proposed determination would provide much more regulatory certainty than withdrawing it, and a permit application is not needed to augment the factual record.

The side stepping of due process legislation was the reason Northern Dynasty filed legal suits against the EPA. And this is the reason the law suit reached a settlement. Furthermore, the ""proposed determination"" is a pre-emptive determination that is not based on any Pebble mine plan, it is based on a best guess Pebble mine plan. 

Let the due process of the environmental legislation follow its lawful course, and allow the decision of permitting for Northern Dynasty Minerals be based on merit, not fanfare.

Do not not withdraw the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination, which it made pursuant to the Clean Water Act in 2014.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, supports tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, is a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and is the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs.

I support the settlement decision to withdraw the proposed EPA Region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination to restrict the use of certain waters in the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds in southwest Alaska as disposal sites for dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit.   To do otherwise would seem to be a breach of the settlement agreement.  

Furthermore: 

Making a determination before a proposal is even submitted is simply bad public policy. By failing to put a stop to the effort that lead to the determination as soon as he became aware of it, the administrator treated the holders of the mineral lease unfairly and wasted considerable public resources.  He and all those involved should be held accountable for their action (or lack thereof).

In the course of my work I have worked in Alaska and become friends with many Alaskans whose livelihoods depend on the Bristol Bay watershed. These fisheries support thousands of Alaskans and according to the EPA's own 2014 assessment of mining impacts the watershed's ecological resources generated nearly $480 million in direct economic expenditures and sales and provided employment for over 14,000 full- and part-time workers in 2009.

Alaskans do not support mining in the Bristol Bay watershed as demonstrated by the 2014 statewide ballot measure. 

The 25 Tribal Nations who call the Bristol Bay watershed home do not support mining development. 

EPA's watershed assessment was scientifically based and thoroughly peer-reviewed, and the public has had an extensive opportunity to comment on it. The assessment and public comments received should be key components of any future action on this issue.

There are no factual or technical reasons to withdraw the EPA's original determination. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Research is only beginning to understand the widespread and lasting effects of the waste products of mining, especially in our watersheds. Science is clear, however, that these chemicals accumulate up the food web. Wild caught Alaskan salmon with a side of Pebble Mine waste: does that sound like the product of legislative action meant to benefit the American people? No. It sounds like action taken by a government more interested in streamlining the efficiency of economic flow to mining industry. As a citizen of this country I reject the narrative that lifting restrictions on this project will benefit me, my country's economy. I reject this, because I cannot find a serious ecologist who wouldn't underline this legistlation as a detriment to the ecosystems Southeast Alaska relies on.

As a user and consumer of fish from Bristol Bay, it does not seem worth it to risk the release of contaminants and heavy metals into the waterways leading to an area so prized for its fish. The vast majority of mines release contaminants into the environment, and the EPA knows this. 

The original water quality restriction was put in place based on science. Removing this restriction for any other reason than a change in science is wrong.

Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs.

I am unalterably opposed to withdrawing the EPA's proposed determination lifting restrictions on Pebble Mine's treatment of debris and discharge of waste water in the headwaters of Bristol Bay. So doing will poison the breeding grounds of the world's greatest population of red salmon.

Withdrawing the restrictions 1) threatens the future of Bristol Bay's commercial and recreational fishery which generates annually more than $500 million and more than 1,000 jobs in small towns in the watershed and 2) opens the door to exploitation of similar low-grade ore deposits throughout Alaska.

Further, Bristol Bay's unstable geology is plagued by earthquakes. The mine is located in the fault zone which experienced a 7.1 scale earthquake (Iniskin Quake) last year. A quake similar to the one which rocked Anchorage in 1964 could devastate not only waste treatment facilities, but the mine itself.

So flimsy is financing behind Northern Dynasty Minerals, owner of Pebble mining rights, and so scant is the prospect for expansion in the world's copper market, that it's very doubtful that the company can attract capital to ensure safe operation of the mine and related infrastructure during and beyond its proposed 78-year lifespan. 

Thank you for considering my comments.

Please give The Pebble Project a fighting chance

Please withdraw from pursuing any further action against the Pebble Project. 

I strongly believe in preserving the environment for future generations. A main concern of mine is we all need the vital resources that are underground ready to mined at the proposed Pebble Site. Our Country and the world needs these resources. The United States have environmental conscious regulations that keep our waterways and soil protected for future generations. If we veto any proposed mine in the United States it will force us to purchase those minerals elsewhere, and those minerals come from Countries that can care less about the environment damaging the environment to dangerous levels. It is best for the economy and for the environment to mine here in America, where we have environmental conscious regulations, rather than to resort to purchasing minerals from other Countries that simply do not care a about the environment. 

A little about me
I recently had to move out of Alaska, could not find a job other than a low paying Mcdonalds wage. I previously worked in the land surveying profession and there is virtually no surveying jobs in Alaska. This mine gives hope to the poverty stricken Alaskans, it will not only help the villages and groups of minorities but it will also aid in taking Alaska out of the skyrocketing budget deficit it currently faces. I am very poor, I live with my wife and two kids in Central Oregon and picking pine cones in the National Forest to pay the bills, but only get $5 per bag. This mine would provide a way out for people like me and so many Alaskans, a means to put food on the table and a paycheck to keep the lights on. Not only the direct jobs but its also the indirect jobs it will provide. The mine will need laborers, engineers, architects, contractors, land surveyors, heavy equipment, equipment operators, project managers,  motels, the list goes on and on. The truth of the matter is it will provide incredible job creation and yet keep mining in our home land where we do care about the environment rather than shipping our jobs overseas and letting them poison the waterways in other parts of the world. 

I strongly believe in the Pebble Project, I strongly believe it can be constructed conscious to the environment. 

Please let this mine move forward, it will give people like myself hopes and dreams. So many Alaskans struggle with alcoholism, drugs, violence and the list goes on. Having a means to provide a middle class wage and a way to raise a family will keep their minds from idle and more likely to go after their dreams and goals rather than to resort to an epidemic that is happening in some of the Alaskan villiages. 

Please, please let this mine move forward without harsh backlash, it will benefit not just Alaska but the entire world.

PLEASE give it a chance, it can and will be constructed in a matter that will keep the fish unharmed.

Furthermore, the EPAs own assessment identifies that water quality in the Bristol Bay watershed would be measurably diminished through leachate resulting from tailings, as well as routine operations.  Increased copper levels would have a direct effect on salmonids ranging from avoidance of the contaminated habitat to rapidly induced death of many or all fish.

A determination to withdraw the EPA's prior decision to restrict mining operations and disposal of tailings consistent with the authority and purpose of the Clean Water Act is an abdication of your responsibility as the Environmental Protection Agency.

In the published notice in the Federal Register, the EPA noted that withdrawing the Proposed Determination ""would remove any uncertainty, real or perceived, about PLP's ability to submit a permit application and have the permit application reviewed.""

The American Exploration & Mining Association warned that EPA's actions at Pebble are ""sending a chilling message to the business and investment community, and has had a negative impact on exploration and mining projects not only in Alaska, but the entire United States. In fact, the world and its investment community are watching. EPA's action at Pebble will clearly indicate whether the United States is open for investment, or closed to innovation, opportunity and job creation.""

Ruling against a project at the end of an open process that prioritized science and informed decision-making is a possibility every investor faces.  Investors do not expect, however, to be shut out of a contrived, one-sided process from the beginning and informed of the rejection at the end.  That is exactly what EPA did to PLP when it initiated the preemptive veto here 

The harmful effects of continuing with EPA's veto process will go well beyond the mining industry, as 404 permits are required in so many circumstances that they affect every area of our economy.  

The Corps processes approximately 60,000 permits a year, and, according to some estimates, roughly $220 billion of investment per year depends on these permits.  These investors expect regulators to place reasonable restrictions on projects; they typically do not expect regulators to make preemptive decisions based on new policy courses before an application is even submitted.  For the process to be fair, developers must have a full opportunity to present plans, defend science, and modify projects to meet legitimate concerns.  This is good policy; it is also the law.

I am a scientist and I have studied salmon reproduction, development and toxic levels of mercury in the fillet tissue. Copper is a powerful poison to salmon eggs and juvenile salmon. Very small amounts of copper waste can exterminate a salmon stream. 
Methyl mercury is a by product of gold smelting. Methyl mercury bio accumulates in salmon fillet tissue. Methyl mercury is deadly to humans and even in small amounts causes brain damage, tremors and impetus.

Griffiths,,,False,EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369-0001,,,2017-08-19T04:00Z,2017-08-19T04:00Z,,,,,,,,Public Comment,,,,,,1.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"To the Acting Regional Administrator, EPA Region 10 and Administrator Pruitt,

My public comment is to recommend against the withdrawal of the July 2014 Proposed Determination and, if a withdrawal decision is made, I recommend that the Administrator should review and reconsider to prevent the withdrawal. 

In the attached document you will find my full comment and reasons for my recommendation against the withdrawal of the Proposed Determination. 

In brief:
(1) The settlement does not require that the withdrawal should occur if there is no basis to the reasons for the withdrawal. 
(2) There can be no misunderstanding or confusion on the part of the PLP about whether or not a permit can be submitted to the Army Corps while the Proposed Determination is in effect.  EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369 clearly states that ""EPA Region 10's initiation of the section 404(c) process did not prohibit PLP from filing a permit application and the Army Corps could have processed such a permit application while a section 404(c) review was ongoing.""   
(3) The existence of the Proposed determination did not prevent PLP from filing a permit with the Army Corps. This proposal has failed to explain why LPL should be provided more time give that they have had at least since (but even before) the July 2014 Proposed Determination to apply for a permit with the Army Corps but they have failed to do so in the subsequent three years.  Moreover, as the Proposed Determination does not prevent the filing of a permit in the future, the stated cause of ""additional time"" has no basis.
(4) EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369 states  ""the Agency believes that withdrawing the Proposed Determination now, while allowing the factual record regarding any forthcoming permit application to develop, is appropriate at this time for this particular matter. *Why the Proposed determine should not be withdrawn*: The statement cited here is included in the paragraph of stated reasons for withdrawal.  It is impossible to evaluate this statement and it provides no substantive argument for the claims.  Why is this an appropriate action?  Why for this time and place?  The EPA needs to provide more substantial arguments as to why 10-years of scientific research, synthesis and public comment and the Proposed Determination that came out of that work should suddenly be withdrawn because it is ""appropriate.""
(5) Furthermore, the withdrawal of the Proposed Determination, rather than increasing in the efficiency of the permitting process, would make it less efficient and effective.  Taxpayers support the 10-years of work that led to the Proposed Determination. If the settlement was supposed to prevent costly litigation then the EPA should not waste the taxpayer's dollars by doing away with an incredibly valuable and highly rigorous document that the tax payers spent 10 years paying for. 

Finally, if the Regional Administrators approves a withdrawal, the Administrator should reconsider.  It is unconscionable that EPA should abdicate its 404(c) authority in this way by withdrawing the Proposed Determination.  The proposed withdrawal is not consistent with the Agency's mission as stated on the EPA website (https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do). The Proposed Determination found that there were significant risks of mining in the Bristol Bay watershed and it is EPA's mission to ensure ""all Americans are protected from significant risks to human health and the environment where they live, learn and work.""  EPA's mission is also that ""national efforts to reduce environmental risk are based on the best available scientific information"" and it is clear that the Proposed Determination had robust, extensive expert review resulting in it reflecting the best available science that should be part of the Army 404(c) permit process. The mission is also that ""federal laws protecting human health and the environment are enforced fairly and effectively"" - a 10-year process to obtain the determination, with ample opportunities for PLP to engage is a fair enforcement while withdrawing the Proposed Determination would be a less effective enforcement.  

Ultimately, the overall mission of the EPA is ""to protect human health and the environment"" (https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa). Fulfilling this mission should be the only priority of the EPA Administrator and withdrawing the Proposed Determination is in direct conflict with this mission statement. Removing the Proposed Determination will result in a potential permitting process that does not ensure that human health and the environment have the best available science and risk reduction recommendations considered. Therefore, the Administrator should reconsider and prevent any withdrawal of the Proposed Determination.

Thank you for considering my comment,
Jennifer Griffiths

Those risks include loss of up to up to 94 miles of salmon-supporting streams and up to 4,900 acres of wetlands and ponds, and the very real potential of wastewater dam failure resulting in damage to or destruction of the salmon fishery. The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world and 25 federally recognized tribes who for 4,000 years have depended on the fishery for their subsistence-based culture. The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the project, and a statewide majority of voters also oppose it. The watersheds unique ecological resources generate significant economic benefits and employment. EPAs original watershed assessment was scientifically robust and thoroughly peer-reviewed. That assessment and related public comments should strongly influence any future action.

The Pebble Mine prospect is the wrong mine in the wrong place. Bristol Bay's salmon fishery are integral to food security worldwide and critical to local subsistence, as well as to economic survival of commercial fishermen, tribes, sportsmen, tourist operators, chefs and local businesses. This productive and responsibly managed fishery is the largest wild salmon run in the world. Developing the largest mine in North America on top this sensitive and wild eco-system is short sighted, valuing mining profits over long-term sustainable economic gains and food security through fishing. 

Bristol Bay salmon runs are worth preserving. They have thrived for thousands of years and could continue to do so. Their preservation should be the fundamental priority in this area. 

Please do not even consider short-term mine profits that would threaten the Bristol Bay fishery and way of life. It is far too risky to put mine on such a critically important and fragile ecosystem.

It is my belief that the Pebble mine should be allowed to proceed; that new clean mining technologies allow for the co-existence of mining and clean water/fisheries in the region.

I am in full support of Scott Pruitt removing E.P.A. Roadblocks to the permitting and development of a facility that would enrich the State of Alaska with jobs, infrastructure and tax revenue.

While nobody wants to see the earth polluted, watersheds destroyed or wildlife harmed, especially in a beautiful and pristine wilderness area; those same people generally do not want to see all progress halted, nor their State & Nation driven into poverty.  Those same people would prefer not to be personally driven to poverty and left destitute by overreaching draconian ""policies and procedures"".

Much of the outcry on the issue is based on assumptions about mining that are outdated.  And I reiterate that many advances have been made in mining technologies, making processes ""Green"" and in many cases having no or minimal impact on the environment.  Is this the only mine in Alaska?  Is it going to destroy the entire state?  Will it have any effect on fisheries for hundreds of miles around?  I think the answers to all those questions is a resounding NO.  Which begs the question: What is the point to the regulatory bulwark?  There is no point.

I urge for progress and support the removal of E.P.A. interference in the area.

Such an action would be devastating to the wildlife in the Bristol Bay watershed including nearly half of all the sockeye salmon in the world. Please help stop this action.

If the proposed withdrawal is granted/approved, it will most assuredly result in the PLP (Pebble Limited Partnership) and its subsidiary Northern Dynasty Minerals Limited creating a copper-gold mine within the Bristol Bay Watershed, including creation of a tailings storage facility dam to store tailings created by development of said mine.

That watershed is home to a very large percentage of all the wild sockeye salmon (over 45%) that are responsibly caught for human consumption.  Wild sockeye salmon are a resource of great value to humans.  While some people may deem the risk of partial failure of the dam to contain/confine stored tailings as an acceptable risk, I do not.  The destruction to sockeye salmon fishermen businesses would be quite devastating.  And, the loss of this food would be too.

The failure of other retention dams in other parts of the US have resulted in devastating affects on human life nearby and on nearby non-human life.  I believe the risk of dam failure is too high to justify withdrawal of the Determination to Restrict the proposed mining use.

The EPA noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300 million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon, generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon also support a traditional Native way of life that still thrives today.

Bristol Bay is a crucial component of the ecosystem that supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world. Thousands of individuals rely on this fishery for sustenance, and the risk of wastewater dam failure destroying this important natural resource is far too great.

It is my understanding that the EPA has already conducted a scientifically rigorous, peer-reviewed evaluation of this watershed and found it to have significant economic and ecological benefits that would be threatened by the proposed Pebble Mine. Furthermore, the majority of statewide voters and Bristol Bay residents are opposed to the Pebble project. The original EPA assessment in combination with these public comments from local residents should be more than enough evidence to preserve the initial CWA determination.

This can happen without hurting the fishing and hunting industries.

Alaska will be much better off financially and people will sleep better knowing they have followed the regulations.

The Bristol Bay watershed deserves the highest levels of protection the Clean Water Act can provide because it is home to a fishery resource of global importance, including the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world.

According to EPA's own documents (U.S. EPA. An Assessment of Potential Mining Impacts on Salmon Ecosystems of Bristol Bay, Alaska (Final Report). U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC, EPA 910-R-14-001A-C, ES, 2014. Chapter 5.), the watershed's ecological resources generated nearly a half a billion dollars in direct economic activity and provided more than 14,000 jobs in 2009 alone. Importantly, this valuable economic activity is sustained by the renewable nature of the ecological resources that underlie it.

In addition to being a resource of enormous economic importance, the Bristol Bay watershed is extremely significant from a cultural standpoint because it has been a source of Alaskan Native People's subsistence for at least four millennia. Only by maintaining the fullest protections afforded by the Clean Water Act can our Nation ensure that the irreplaceable ecological resources of the watershed will continue to provide subsistence, jobs and salmon for a worldwide market

Mining and the infrastructure required to support it in this area is simply too risky, and Northern Dynasty, the company that wants to exploit the mineral deposits in the watershed, does not appear to have the technical and financial capability to operate in a way that would protect Bristol Bay and its watershed. Thus, EPA should not withdraw its July 2014 determination restricting dumping of mining waste in the Bristol Bay watershed.

Please reconsider withdrawing the 2014 Proposed Determination allowing Pebble Mine to begin its application for the mine. Plans for Pebble Mine SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. 

Three of Bristol Bay's eight major rivers, The Kvichak (Kwee-Jack), Naknek, and Nushagek, collectively support the greatest wild salmon fishery in the world. The sockeye salmon are at the center of the ecosystem. Their eggs and their flesh, once the salmon die after spawning, feed everything in the system, from invertebrates and bears, to eagles, wolves, beluga and killer whales. A negative impact on the sockeye population could result in the collapse of the ecosystem. It would also create a collapse of an incredibly important fishing industry.

The proposed Pebble Mine is to be situated immediately up-gradient of this renowned, salmon fishery

EPA has a part of the Clean Water Act called Section 404(c), which allows the EPA to ""restrict, prohibit, deny or withdraw the use of an area as a disposal site for dredged or fill material if the discharge will have unacceptable adverse effects on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife or recreational areas."" There are many reasons that the mine should not be allowed to progress, and that the Proposed Determination should not be withdrawn. The notice for public comment states that EPA ""is not soliciting comment on the proposed restrictions or on science or technical information underlying the Proposed Determination."" HOW else do you make this type of decision? Since there is not another way to make that decision, I am adding some science below. 

The proposed site has sulfide rock that when exposed to air and water creates acid that can increase copper and other harmful pollutants concentrations downstream. Rain can also mobilize and wash copper and other pollutants into salmon habitat. Copper in small amounts can be lethal and have sub-lethal effects that increases mortality rates and decrease survival and production. Salmon and their food sources have a very low tolerance for this pollutant [copper]
The mine site includes an open pit along with a road. Two toxic tailing lakes would be required, contained by earthen dams. These dams would be huge.  While NDM states it will use a layer of water on top of the tailing lakes to help limit available oxygen (thus the amount of acid and metals created) these earthen dams would be sited in a seismically active region with volatile weather patterns, extreme flooding events, severe winters, and high winds. The dams would also need to contain the tailings and would need permanent maintenance, not just for decades, but forever, long after NDM is gone.


Even economic prognosis of this project is poor: A number of the world's largest mining corporations have pulled out of the project, including Mitsubishi, Rio Tinto and Anglo American - the last of which had about $500 million in the project. Why ruin an ecosystem for companies that are not sure it will a valuable asset?

PLEASE do not withdraw the Proposed Determination that prevents Pebble from progressing.

The potential impacts of the proposed Pebble Mine on the health of the Bristol Bay watershed and the livelihood of thousands of people in Alaska are too great to accept:

The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world.

The watershed is home to 25 federally recognized tribal governments who have maintained a salmon-based culture and subsistence-based way of life for at least 4,000 years that would be placed in jeopardy.

The watershed's ecological resources generated nearly $480 million in direct economic expenditures and sales and provided employment for over 14,000 full- and part-time workers in 2009.

Contrary to comments by the backers of the Pebble Mine project, EPA's watershed assessment was scientifically based and thoroughly peer-reviewed, and the public has had an extensive opportunity to comment on it. The assessment and public comments received should be key components of any future action on this issue.

The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the project.  A statewide majority of voters also oppose it, as evidenced by the 2014 State-wide ballot measure.

The rationale for the proposed withdrawal is flawed. Finalizing the proposed determination would provide much more regulatory certainty than withdrawing it, and a permit application is not needed to augment the factual record.

This area is the epicenter of the most productive salmon habitat in the world.  Upper Talarik Creek is a tributary to Lake Iliamna, and the Koktuli is a tributary of the Nushagak River. Opening the doors to let mine operators dump tailings in these waters will poison and devastate this hugely valuable sustainable natural resource. The July 2014 determination was made for a great quantity of good reasons, and should not be reversed.

I live in Bellingham, Washington. I know many fellow residents, commercial fishermen, whose livelihood depends on the Bristol Bay fishery. It is no good trading a vast natural resource with a rich and sustainable economic impact for a one-time harvest of minerals with its irreversible destruction, for the benefit of foreign companies. I have seen these mining operations and the destruction they cause, in Canada, Chile, Colorado, Utah, Indonesia. Some of these mines were opened over a hundred years ago, and they are still leaching uncontrolled acid mine drainage into natural waters. They without exception create permanent sacrifice areas and destroyed streams for the rest of time -- despite the bland promises and pious assurances of the mine interests that everything will be ok and no damage will happen.

It is extremely important that the 2014 determination not be withdrawn.

Yet this is an active earthquake zone! A similar containment dam failed in 2014 at the Mount Polly copper and gold mine in British Columbia decimating the surrounding area. President Obama's EPA decided after much studying that mega-mines like the proposed Pebble Mine would likely destroy the ecology of Bristol Bay and its headwaters and therefore should be prohibited.

This comment is submitted regarding the EPA's Proposed Determination on the Pebble Mine under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act.

I support and agree with the EPA's finding that mining activity on any level within the Bristol Bay, Alaska watershed poses unacceptable risks to the fragile Bristol Bay watershed.  The watershed is a fragile ecosystem of global significance that supports almost half of the world's sockeye salmon population.  Any sort of mining development or mining accident will directly cause irreversible environmental damage.  The watershed supports 14,000 jobs and generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually in economic activity. 

The EPA's own analysis found that the proposed mine would harm this critically important watershed and I support a decision to move forward with the EPA Proposed Determination on the Pebble Mine under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act without further delay.

The proposed open-pit Pebble gold mine poses an unacceptable risk to Bristol Bay, a world-class fishery that supplies 40 percent of the fresh seafood caught annually in the United States, producing more than $2.4 billion annually in economic value.

Bristol Bay is the heart of this nation's seafood industry. Its waters produce an abundance of King Crab, halibut, cod, herring, pollock, and salmon - including the world's largest wild run of Sockeye Salmon. As an economic engine and a vital natural resource, Bristol Bay is a national treasure deserving of our most diligent stewardship.

There could not be a worse place to locate a large mining operation, which includes huge toxic tailings lagoons. In addition to destroying more than 22 square miles of this vital watershed, the risk of a dam blowout is high due to a high level of geologic activity in the area, including volcanoes and earthquakes. Such a blowout would devastate the Alaska fishing industry and one of America's most productive natural resources.

No doubt, this is why more than 80 percent of those who live in the region oppose the Pebble Mine proposal being pursued by the foreign-owned Pebble Limited Partnership.

Some of those risks include loss of up to up to 94 miles of salmon-supporting streams and up to 4,900 acres of wetlands and ponds, and the very real potential of wastewater dam failure resulting in damage to or destruction of the salmon fishery. The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world and 25 federally recognized tribes who have depended on the fishery for their subsistence-based culture. The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the project, and a statewide majority of voters also oppose it. Listen to and act on their concerns. The watersheds unique ecological resources generate significant economic benefits and employment. EPAs original watershed assessment was scientifically robust and thoroughly peer-reviewed. That assessment and related public comments should strongly influence any future action.

I am writing ask the EPA stand with American jobs and communities by not withdrawing the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination, which it made pursuant to the Clean Water Act in 2014.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents.


Even investors are have found the Pebble Project to be an unworthy investment. 

John Doody, gold stock analyst, stated in an interview that ""The problem is that the deposit doesn't work... [the pebble deposit may] have tens of millions of ounces, but there are a billion ounces [of gold] in the ocean that doesn't mean it is economic to go get it""; ""The problem is that the economics don't work in Northern Dynasty's Pebble Project"" he continues. 


After calculating the total desired mineral concentration (gold, copper, silver and Molybdenum combined), with Pebble Partnership's data,  is .0472%, which is very low grade ore. It also means that there will be about 10.7949 billion tons of waste rock from the 10.8 billion tons of ore. The Pebble Partnership claims that, in addition to a 1300 acre mine pit (that is about 4000 ft deep), a 3600 acre tailings compound and a  2300 acre waste rock pile, there will be a processing plant and a natural gas power plant. The Pebble Partnership also claims that there will be four 86-mile buried pipelines to transport mineral concentrates, water and fuel to the Iniskin Bay Port to be shipped away.  The mine has been estimated to use over 36 million gallons of diesel fuel a year and 378 MW of electricity, which is equivalent to 21.6% of Alaska's total energy capacity. It would also use 35 billion gallons of fresh water per year- more water than the entire city of Anchorage uses.

There are a multitude of potential issues that can occur. The buried pipelines that care mineral concentrates and fuel could leak unnoticed due to extreme temperature changes and ground movements from dynamite use. The fuel and concentrates could also spill while at the port. With its remote location it is very far from rescue  and spill response teams. A pit that goes that far into the ground could breach numerous streams and aquifers, the pit would fill faster than it's being pumped, much like the Berkeley Pit Mine in Montana. The extensive glacial gravel deposits in the region are highly permeable and that can allow mine waste to move from between surface and groundwater. 

Even without any accidents or spills, the Pebble Mine would have an extremely big environmental footprint that would eliminate 87 miles of salmon streams and at least 4200 acres of critical wetland habitat. Taking away billions of gallons of groundwater from the Bristol Bay watershed could also lower the flow of the streams and tributaries that feed into the Nushagak and Kvichak Rivers.  The mining operation would require the use of: greases, antifreeze, water treatment chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, and road deicing compounds. These substances can come in contact with groundwater and rivers through runoff, harming any aquatic life present.The total carbon dioxide emissions have been estimated to be around 1.9 million tons per year, contributing to ocean acidification and climate change. Even if leached waste material doesn't harm salmon directly, tiny traces of it can hinder the development of the eggs and kill off zooplankton-the salmon's primary food source. Salmon are very fatty fish, which mean that they can store traces of pollutants and heavy metals in their fatty tissue through bioaccumulation. One of the reasons that make Alaskan wild-caught salmon so valuable is that the it has almost non-existent levels of mercury and pollutants because the waters they live in are so pristine and undeveloped. Therefore, even if loose tailings don't disturb adult fish, fry, or zooplankton etc. it would still lower the quality of the meat since there would be higher concentrations of pollutants in the fatty tissue of the fish.  

Please do not withdraw the proposed determination to restrict the proposed Pebble Mine.

Yes to jobs!  and yes to Salmon too!

I am a life-long Alaskan, residing in Anchorage.  My background is in heavy equipment operation and road construction, and I can tell you the Pebble mine would be a great thing for us.  I have long suffered the cyclical nature of construction in Alaska, and a lucrative, year-round job like the ones Pebble will offer would be fantastic.  My son who is about to graduate high school could look to the Pebble mine as a potential for lifetime employment as well, as he plans to follow me into construction.

The people I have spoken to who oppose or are uninformed about Pebble, all seem to dwell on the mistaken idea that the mine will ""wipeout all the salmon""  or ""devastate the Bristol Bay"".  As I have seen time and again, the environmentalists and extremists are painting a picture that is way over the top, and greatly understates the vast size of our State and resources, as well as the Bristol Bay itself.  I can't see a scenario where even a huge mine would do that.  And it's my understanding anyway that they are scaling it back to appease these groups, making such a thing even less likely.

I would be first in line to apply for a reliable, consistent job there.  I can tell you with my work experience I'd be a shoe-in and if not, I would defiantly be employed on the massive build-out of infrastructure necessary to make that mine a reality.  A win-win for myself, my family and the State too!

Over my working career I have seen the technology, techniques and safety standards in construction increase incredibly.  I have every bit of faith that the engineers designing this will do their jobs, and you folks at the EPA will do yours as well, insuring the highest standards are met.  I do it every day I'm at work, and I know you will to.  Many of our biggest projects have met with the same vocal resistance only to work out just fine and operate for decades problem-free.

Let the qualified professionals - and this includes yourselves - do their jobs and design, approve and build a state of the art mine, held to the highest safety standards, for all of us to profit from for generations to come.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

This in reguard to the pebble project in Southwest Alaska.

I want to see what the Army Corp of engineers comes up with in their 
environmental impact study before making any judgment on the project 
going forward. 
This I know is no slam dunk because of the native Eskimo opposition 
to this project and also the Hollywood environmentalist. 
So much will be lost in revenue for the area and the state including 
cheaper electricity and roads if this project is stopped. 
Not to mention good paying jobs for the locals.

Please do not withdraw the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination, which it made pursuant to the Clean Water Act in 2014.

 

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries, supporting tens of millions of wild running salmon. The region support thousands of fisheries and recreation-based jobs that would be jeopardized by using these watersheds as a dump for mining waste. 65% of Alaskans and 80% of Bristol Bay residents oppose the proposed Pebble Mine.

 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

 

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs.

The proposed Pebble Mine project -- and its toxic waste -- will put Bristol Bay at risk, and could have severe negative economic impact on the local economy. It will also create irreparable harm the environment in the immediate area, as well as to the wildlife, such as grizzly bears and wolves, who depend on salmon as a source of food, in and around the watershed. Finally, the thought of eating fish that would be swimming in and near the disposal site of the Pebble Mine project should be enough to make everyone sick.

Pebble Mine creates much more harm than good to both the environment and the economy. The proposed withdrawal should not proceed.

The EPA has no right or authority to take such unprecedented preemptive action to shut down resource development anywhere, and especially not on State of Alaska lands which were selected for their mineral prospectively and conveyed to Alaska under terms of the Statehood Act.

The proposition that the development of one mine could destroy the Bristol Bay salmon fishery is ludicrous, even one the size of Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah.

There is a permitting process which is in place to ensure that if such a mine were to be developed, it would be developed in an environmentally responsible manner.

The State of Alaska's economy is based on natural resource development, and the Pebble mineral belt holds great potential to create long term employment, a local tax base in the region, and a general underpinning of the supply and logistics industries in south central Alaska.

Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I am a long time shareholder of NDM and would not want them to harm salmon but I do want the company to be given due process which includes a full review by Army Corp of Engineers.

If the mine can't be built safely then fisheries should win out.  If however, a mine can be built safely and if it can co-exist with salmon then it should allowed to proceed. After all, this area has been designated for mining.

Only after following due process with all of its checks and balances can we make the correct determination as to whether the mine belongs.  Only then can we believe and trust the results.  That is why I strongly believe the motion to withdraw should be enacted.  This would go a long ways to correcting a major injustice that has been inflicted on this company and hopefully would help restore badly needed faith in the system.  Either we believe in our checks and balances or we don't.  The real question here is whether or not this mine can co-exist with salmon.  Let's find out through proper channels and due process.

It is critical that all watersheds supplying sockeye stocks to Bristol Bay be protected, as >70 years of study (Schindler, Quinn, and Hilborn, Univ. of Washington, Seattle) have shown that individual watersheds wax and wane in their  importance as sources to the ocean populations, but the portfolio of all watersheds together sustains steady high returns of valuable salmon from the ocean to the Bay.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

I would like to voice my support of the withdraw of this determination. 
 I have followed this case very closely.  I have watched hours of testimony, and read dozens of pages pn how this was handled by the EPA.  It was nothing short of criminal.
 If the people who want to build this mine submit their plans, and the ACoE determines it is unsafe then by all means deny them their permits. Or make the changes needed to protect the Sockeye salmon run.   But the process is the process.  You don't tell a man who wants to build a house that you wont look at his plans. And you dont tell the rest of the Natural resource Investment world that they are unsafe putting their dollars in America.
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, if they can do it safely, I would prefer to have America secure in its access to resources, AND to be overseeing the mine and its use.
 All the people who say ""Not here"" don't seem to realize that  in America we have the best chance of making ANY miner be responsible and make them pay for proper disposal, and safe practice. The world will get its copper. If not here then from somewhere where the labor could be children or slaves for that matter. The waste will be dumped right into the environment..
I am for the normal course of permitting to be followed here. And to hold these miners to the high standard here in America to get the resources responsibly.
  Thank you",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Throughout our nations history, despite assurances and mitigation, we've seen mining efforts wreak havoc on fisheries.  As a regular visitor to Alaska, and recreational fisherman, Bristol Bay is a destination and renewable natural resource worthy of rigorous protection.  

The concentrated and relatively short term rewards of opening/empowering mining in this area are lesser than the continued and perpetual returns of salmon and wildlife we gain by protecting Bristol Bay.  Do your job and PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT (like it says in your job title).

It could not have been stated any better in terms of why and for what reasons I think the proposed determination should be withdrawn.  It covers much of how I feel.  I simply added the last paragragh to fully express my thoughts:

Alaska and specifically Bristol Bay is in dire need of the Pebble mine. The younger generation of Alaskans deserve to have meaningful and decent paying jobs. Of 5,394 working age residents in Bristol Bay, only 63% worked in 2011 and only 35% were employed throughout the year. By providing Alaska and Bristol Bay 3,000 high wage jobs (mine workers average over $100,000/year), Pebble will provide a much needed boost to the regional economy in Bristol Bay. Pebble mine would increase Lake and Peninsula Borough tax base by a staggering 600% over 2013 levels while the infrastructure build out for the project would provide affordable electricity for Southwest Alaska. Pebble-related economic activity in Alaska will boost the state's GDP by more than 3% over 2011 levels as the mine will generate $1 billion in annual operating expenditures in the area. Northern Dynasty has publicly stated that they won't go ahead with the mine if it means sacrificing the salmon. Ultimately, the rule of law needs to be upheld and the Army Corps of Engineers should have the final say on whether the project should go ahead. To not allow this mine to go through without valid reasoning is to deny thousands of Alaskans good paying jobs without a reason and to prevent the greater Alaskan economy from reaching its potential. 

Allow a normalized full review to take place so that we can all find out once and for all whether or not this mine is viable.  Nothing more nothing less.  This project has been unduly manipulated for too many years and at an incredible cost to the company.  Again special interests.  Take them out of the equation by finally truly normailizing back to the established processes.  Unless of course you don't trust the process.

For the sake of being appropriate, I am submitting the comment below since the words I'd like to use do not follow guidelines.  


I am opposed to EPAs proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents.

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.

I'm writing to the Environmental Protection Agency to urge the agency  to continue to restrict Pebble Limited Partnership from using Bristol Bay in Southeast Alaska as a deposit site for their mining operations. The bay is one of the world's most important wild salmon fisheries, which supports 14,000 full and part-time jobs. 

Also, the 2014 decision to restrict mining has been examined and peer-reviewed by many in the scientific community, and it shows that mining would cause a tremendous amount of environmental damage, as well as negatively affect the livelihood of those that depend on the bay to produce a healthy fishery.

For these reasons, I urge the EPA to continue restricting mining access to Bristol Bay. Mines will undoubtedly destroy the salmon fishery and the surrounding environment, as well as destroy the livelihoods and economies of the surrounding Native American communities and fishermen.

I thank you for both your time and the opportunity to voice my concerns on this matter.

Sincerely,
Kyle Gould ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Based on information in your assessment, Bristol Bay should be declared an ""Aquatic Resource of National Importance"", the proposed determination should not be withdrawn until and unless there is a new proposal that does not include the need to restrict the use of certain waters in the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds (located within the larger Bristol Bay watershed) as disposal sites for dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

The Clean Water Rule was adopted to help protect crucial waterways, including streams that feed the drinking water sources of more than 117 million Americans -- that's approximately one in three Americans. 
 
Without Clean Water Rule protections, mining companies, factory farms and other industries could more easily pollute some our nation's most vital waterways.
 
It's the EPA's responsibility to do everything in its power to make sure that every American has access to clean drinking water. Clean water is not just a right -- it's a necessity.
 
I urge you to reverse course and stop this attack on the Clean Water Rule, to defend critical waterways and protect our nation's drinking water!  Thank you.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries.

The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

If a foreign group proposed this, it would be considered terrorism due to its threat to clean water and salmon.  It is time to protect the resources of our country.

Basis: 
The research and science shows that the risks created by the proposed project cannot, within acceptable certainty, protect the fisheries of the area.  The Bristol Bay is the largest fishery of wild salmon in the world. 
The people of the area, region, and state have opposed the proposed project.  There is no evidence that the proposed project carries a higher priority for the nation than continued protection for the fishery and dependent industry. 
The dependent fishery industry supports some 14,000 people.  Many family owned and small independent business are dependent on a healthy and long term fishery.  Their interest should be given higher consideration than a proposed conflicting new industry.

Our nation's pristine areas are fast disappearing and the role of our government agencies should always be to protect our environment for current and future generations. Mining, especially mining for copper and gold, dredges up numerous harmful agents (as well as chemicals used to separate the metals) that impact many generations to come. The idea that dredged or fill materials can simply be dumped in watersheds is immoral. It's one thing to take such action from a position of ignorance, but quite another to do so knowing the consequences of such actions that has been evidenced here in the United States as well as countries all over the world. To do so is not only immoral, it is a crime against nature. There is already a problem with EPA having to clean up the detritus left by numerous irresponsible mining operations that have caused pollution to our waterways, fisheries, and land. Why make it easier for such pollution to occur? Please enact the proposed determination to restrict the use of the area as a disposal site.

So much has been said, shouted, written and speculated about Pebble that facts have all but been conveniently swept askew. There have been blatant inaccuracies and distortions of truths in the ever fluctuating compendium of the Pebble Mine, all intended to persuade public opinion, whether it be for or against. The story of the Pebble Mine is besieged by elements and influences in which flow on continuum.

Southwest Alaska is without a doubt a spectacular ecosystem. The panorama ranges from the surreal volcanic landscape of Katmai National Park, tens of thousands of square miles of interior boreal forests, swamps, highlands and the immense mountain barrier of the Aleutian Islands. Alaska is a land of volcanoes, situated on the Pacific Rim along the aforementioned Ring of Fire. The Pebble Deposit itself is at the end of a long chain of volcanoes that comprise the 1,600 mile-long Aleutian Peninsula. 

Right now Pebble is an idea. Absolutely! But, ideas have propelled humankind to achieve things no one thought achievable. Electricity was an idea, flight was an idea, electric vehicles was an idea. It has taken over ten years of geological, environmental and socioeconomic analysis, studies and documentation, as well as intensive engineering effort to determine that Pebble can become the largest existing copper reserve in the world. The prefeasibility and feasibility studies have yet to be completed to indicate the economic viability of Pebble.

It took vision and courage, exhaustive effort and legal battles to be where Pebble stands today, at the precipice of possibly something magnificent. Many questions left unanswered in this story, but will one day will be unveiled. But until then, yes, Pebble is an idea.

	Supplies nearly half the world's sockeye salmon
	Generates $1.5 billion annually, making it the most valuable wild salmon fishery in the world
	Supports 14,000 jobs, including commercial fishers, world-class sports fishers, and Alaska Natives
	Is a beloved tourism spot for individuals and families every summer
	Sustains the culture and traditions of Alaska Natives, including the Yup'ik and Denai'na, two of the last intact, sustainable, salmon-based cultures in the world

These are benefits far greater than any benefits Pebble Mine will support.

I urge you not to withdraw the July 2014 Proposed Determination as this would allow for our natural places such as South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds in southwest Alaska to be used as disposal sites for dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit.

The EPA must use whatever tools it has to protect our shared wild resources, of this there can be no question. 

After the final withdraw decision is made, I urge the Administrator to review and reconsider it in light of the large amount of proven scientific evidence which points to the impact this mining operation will have on the local resources.

Please uphold the July 14th Clean Water Act determination. Bristol Bay has been a haven for salmon, and thousands of other creatures, long before man strutted his way upon the stage.  The idea that one would choose a brief 45-year option to extract minerals and metals along with toxic materials in an area that is pristine and teaming with life is difficult to imagine. 

Designing the infrastructure to support this massive extraction and the impoundments that must be built to contain the toxic waste, in an earthquake prone area, should cause us to pause.  The likelihood that, as in every other open mine on earth, there will be leaks and contamination should make us uphold the EPA's July 2014 Clean Water Act Determination. 

I pray that the citizens now tasked with the planet choose to protect this bountiful and irreplaceable ecosystem over short-term misguided industrial development projects. 

I am told that the mines life span is 45 years. 45 years of extraction. I am a fifty-year-old woman, born in Alaska, and I can attest 45 years is an infinitesimal amount of time compared to the lifespan of the Bristol Bay watershed. The past, present and future of the billions of organisms should far outweigh the billions of dollars sought. 

The dollars generated by the pebble mine are a poor exchange for thousands of years and organisms that would live on a precipitous with the threat of destruction. We are stewards of this planet or we are parasites.

The proposed Pebble Mine is a bad idea.  Unfortunately, the plan to rollback years of public input and additional protections for the Bristol Bay watershed is at stake.  Bristol Bay supports the world's largest wild sockeye salmon fishery, generating one half billion dollars in annual revenue and supporting 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing sectors.

Bristol Bay holds a special place in my heart.  As a veteran guide, and now operating a fly fishing outfitter in northern Michigan, I cut my teeth as a guide in the Bristol Bay region.  I worked, fished, and lived with many people who call Bristol Bay home, and many others who travelled to the region for work or pleasure.  I saw the true nature of the largest wild salmon runs in the world, and the dependence that nearly every animal - wild and human - has on the salmon.  The best part, barring a large environmental disaster - such as is possible with the proposed Pebble mine - the salmon runs do not only provide significant contribution to the Alaskan economy, but they are fully sustainable as well.

Bristol Bay, Alaskans, and Alaska Natives are at risk due to the foreign-owned mining company looking to exploit a region with a noteworthy history and sustainable resources.  More than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents opposed the proposed Pebble Mine.  Furthermore, more than 1.5 million Americans have urged the EPA to provide strong protections for the Bristol Bay watershed.  Foreign-owned interests should not dictate what is best for Alaska, its resources, or the American public.

I do not oppose resource development.  As a land manager and outfitter, I manage timber, water and mineral resource development using sound environmental practices for the betterment of the property.  However, I do oppose resource development in the wrong place, for the wrong reasons.  The proposed Pebble Mine is the wrong mine, in the wrong place, for the wrong reasons.  Approving this mine will set a dangerous precedent for American resource exploitation by foreign interests and the implications of an environmental mishap will affect the region for generations to come.

Some places and resources are just too good to take risks.  Bristol Bay is one of those places, and its salmon runs are one of those resources.

I urge you to keep the protections in place for Bristol Bay.

Sincerely,

Ethan Winchester

This mine would generate 10 billion tons of toxic waste held in retaining dams that have failed in similar sites, contaminating the watershed for many years with devastating effects on both wildlife and human populations. This mine would also consume tremendous volumes of water that would be diverted from fisheries, agriculture, recreational and domestic uses.

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs.

I am outraged that you plan to reverse course and open for consideration a potential green light on the proposed Pebble Mine, despite the catastrophic risks any such mining operation necessarily poses to Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed, its world-renowned salmon runs and its Native communities. No mining whatsoever should be considered in this highly sensitive, ecologically priceless area.

Under the Obama administration, the EPA, after years of rigorous study, proposed science-based restrictions that would have banned the dangerous Pebble Mine to protect Bristol Bay from the myriad of environmental risks this massive gold and copper mine would pose. Your recent settlement with Northern Dynasty Minerals to reverse those common-sense restrictions is a blatant giveaway to the mining industry at the expense of the American people, our environment and our economy.

Bristol Bay's wild salmon fishery supports 14,000 jobs and is valued at more than $1.5 billion annually. It also supplies nearly half of the world's sockeye salmon. More than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen oppose the mine.

I urge you to listen to those voices, and for the sake of the Bristol Bay watershed, its world-class salmon fishery and its people, keep the door closed on Pebble Mine. If you don't, you will have to answer to me and hundreds of thousands of people in Alaska and across the United States and the world who stand in fervent opposition to this toxic mega-mine.

As this nation has seen on other major mining projects, the spoils and dredge of these mines damage waterways through the pollution of heavy metals and toxic minerals. The US government should simply buy back the mineral rights that belong to the people of Alaska. Foreign corporations have no business attaining rights over American land, especially lands that were not originally the US government's. The value of the Sockeye fishery is known. The economic impacts to the fishery would be devastating. To those commentators who speak to the creation of jobs with the Pebble Mine, they are misinformed. Just as in the coal industry and all other industry associated with mineral extraction, jobs are being lost to technological development and automation. It is not economically feasible, if this mine were to go into operation, that a company would hire a large number of personnel given the remote location and hazards associated with the job. They will do like in Germany and Canada and build massive mining machines in order to reduce the human element. The US government does not need to conduct anymore studies into what is already known and a proven point. Regardless of how much mitigation is done, there is no replacing the largest Sockeye fishery on the planet once it has been polluted by the mine spoils. The company that owns the mineral rights made a bad business decision and should absorb the costs of their failures and move on. The US has nothing to gain by losing this economic powerhouse in a region where jobs revolve around the fishery.

I would strongly urge the EPA to not reversing the Obama administration policy of restricting the use of areas near Bristol Bay as disposal sites for the Pebble Mine.

Consider option one.  The EPA opens the path to the construction of the Pebble Mine that can produce ore for max 75 years that is also in tectonically active zone.  Peer-reviewed scientific studies (which are and have been the gold standard of scientific research for centuries) have shown that even construction of the Pebble Mine can cause severe and irreparable damage to salmon breeding and nursery grounds. Not to mention that any sort of significant tectonic activity could result in a comprise of the mine-tailing containment, leading to a massive impact and catastrophic loss of the Bristol fishery -- a fishery that creates 14,000 jobs and $480 million annually and will continue to do so for hundreds of years if managed correctly. And, while I do forgive the EPA for past mistakes, let's acknowledge that the EPA doesn't have a good record of ensuring that toxic mine tailings do not spill into ecologically and economically important waterways (e.g. see the Gold King Mine for an example). Why should the public have confidence that the EPA can prevent this similar type of event to happen near Bristol Bay in a much more challenging environment?   

Consider option two.  The EPA continues the Obama-era restrictions on construction of the Pebble Mine. They thus prevent what scientists have identified as inevitable harm to the Bristol Bay fishery and ensure that a job and money producing industry continues to thrive (i.e. if the Pebble Mine is built the fishery WILL BE impacted according to our best, most successful means of procuring knowledge -- scientific peer review).  I am sorry if the administration ""feels in their gut"" that the Pebble Mine won't be a problem to the fishery.  Gut feelings that are not supported by evidence do not do much to persuade me and are poor ways by which to make decisions.

Of course, the monkey in the room is this 300 billion dollar revenue tag that is placed on the mine. I will be honest, that is a lot of money and people claim that it could be a boost for the Alaskan economy creating 5,000 jobs in Alaska. But keep in mind that this is a finite resource, with production lasting for a maximum of 75 years.  In contrast, the Bristol Bay fishery will, if managed correctly, will consistently generate 300 billion dollars in 600 years (and if you want to talk about climate change now to potentially rebuttal this argument, recognize how hypocritical that will sound...).  Not to mention the billions already generated by this industry. Sure, 600 years sounds like a lot, but this a steady press of half a billion dollars into the Alaskan economy over that time compared to a pulse of of 300 billion dollars over 75 years, with most of that coming in the first 25 years. Moreover, the jobs created by these two industries are not even comparable.  Actually, they are so let's do that too!  Even if the Alaskan Pebble Mine creates 5,000 jobs in Alaska every year for 75 years, that would be 375,000, compared to over a million jobs created by the fishery over that same time period (and, keep in mind, for many years after that).

Please consider this decision in terms of the long-term Alaskan economy.  The choice seems obvious.

Best,

Tales of walking across the backs of salmon to ford a river are not uncommon. Yet, where have these salmon gone? Atlantic salmon have been nearly extirpated from the US east coast. Many waterways comprising the western drainages of America have been dammed, developed, mined, or logged to the point of putting most Pacific salmonid populations on the Endangered Species list. Why should we repeat these mistakes in Alaska? 

The Pebble Mine is a short-lived project, relative to the historic populations of Native Alaskans that have fished and lived in this landscape for millenia, as well as future Alaskans. Those who rely on Bristol Bay salmon also include commercial and recreational fishermen from the lower 48, and the international community, who buys billions of dollars in sockeye salmon and related products annually. More than 60 percent of commercial fishing permits for Bristol Bay are held by non-Alaskans. Projects that pose a threat to this fishery reach far beyond the 7,000 residents of Bristol Bay.  

Sure, the mine will create jobs for the next 50 to 100 years. It will bring wads of cash to the pockets of a Canadian owned mine company and a few executives. It will make some Alaskans feel like the mine is a good idea, but 80 to 90 percent of Bristol Bay residents think that Pebble is a bad idea. Why? Because there is uncertainty. There are unknowns. We may think we fully understand the engineering complexities of a pit mine, but we have no idea what the implications of such an extensive project are for the ecosystem in which it is placed. The short term gains are not worth the long term risks. 

Rivers are the circulatory system of Alaska's fisheries. The complex hydrologic cycle and local geology of Bristol Bay is unique in that it provides the necessary nutrients, water temperatures, and geomorphic features to sustain the complex life history of salmon. Features such as gravel and clay lenses in this drainage encourage subsurface or hyporheic flow. This, in turn, provides for stable water temperatures that keep salmon eggs cool during warm periods, and prevent the gravel beds from freezing during the winter. All of these components allow for a small portion of adult salmon spawners to support a viable population. We can harvest more than half the adult salmon returning to their natal habitats, and still have a healthy return in subsequent years. No single tributary is more important than others. It is the mosaic of these streams that provide for the long-term stability of the overall Bristol Bay sockeye salmon run. In economics and more recently in ecology, we have adopted the portfolio effect, in which a diverse mix of stocks (or in this case, habitats) yield a more stable return over time. A diversity of habitats allows for resiliency, in which individual populations ebb and flow over time, but the overall population remains moderately stable as a result of a diverse portfolio. 

Rivers are not wastewater treatment facilities. They are not flumes for moving contaminants, garbage, or mine tailings from one place to another. They are ecosystems, rich with life and impossible to restore to their natural state. We cannot rebuild something that takes geologic timescales to develop. We cannot afford to put these places at risk. 

I urge you to impose the restrictions on use of waterways as disposal sites, and to maintain protections for the ecosystem that comprises the location of the proposed Pebble Mine site. Please do not withdraw these restrictions. Our future generations will not benefit from another mine. They will, however, appreciate the abundant resources and beauty that Bristol Bay has to offer in its natural state. 

Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,

The EPA took the time to assess potential impacts and evaluate available information and found that; ""the infrastructure necessary to mine the Pebble deposit jeopardizes the longterm health and sustainability of the Bristol Bay ecosystem.""; ""These stream, wetland, and other aquatic resource losses also would reverberate downstream, depriving downstream fish habitats of nutrients, groundwater inputs, and other subsidies from lost upstream aquatic resources.""; and that there is ""reason to believe that unacceptable adverse effects on fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas) could result from the discharge of dredge or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit.""
Restrictions on the discharge of dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit is necessary to avoid these ""unacceptable adverse effects"".  In fact, this pebble mining operation should not be permitted AT ALL!  The protection of this landscape of ""unparalleled ecological value"", is much more cost effective than trying to restore it after the pebble mine destroys it.

I write in support of the communities of Alaska's Bristol Bay and ask you not to withdraw the proposed determination to adopt restrictions protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon. The proposed determination was made at the request of local communities and adopted only after years of rigorous scientific study, public participation and peer review. The EPA was correct in 2014 when it
found that the Pebble Mine would have ""significant and unacceptable adverse effects"" on ""one of the most productive, pristine, valuable and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America today.""

The EPA has noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300 million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon, generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon support not only the commercial and sportfishing industries, but a traditional Native way of life that has endured for millennia and thrives today. The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and take all necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed.

The May 2017 settlement agreement already appears to give preference to the interests of the mining company, over the substantial risks of lasting and widespread harm to the unique and irreplaceable environment of Bristol Bay. 

Why pave the way for a mining company to profit, while Bristol Bay's communities, fish, animals, and native cultures suffer harm? I object strongly to this set of priorities and I want the current use restrictions to be maintained so that Bristol Bay will be protected from contamination. There is more to be gained over the long term from the tourism, fishing, and healthy populations o animals that thrive in this region now. I visited Alaska myself this past August, for the first time in many years. I was born in Alaska before it was a state. The natural beauty and wilderness of Alaska is breathtaking, and leaves me filled with gratitude for the past efforts undertaken by many people to protect it. Native populations have lived here for thousands of years without ruining this ecosystem. It would be tragic if this treasure were to be destroyed by environmental disasters, all within the span of one person's lifetime, and even more so because this risk of harm is entirely preventable. 

Do not withdraw the proposed determination. The science is clear and convincing, showing emphatically that using this area as a disposal site would be hazardous to the environment. It is the EPA's job to protect Bristol Bay's pristine waters, world-renowned salmon runs, abundant wildlife, and Native communities, not threaten them.

Cui Bono?

For Whose Benefit? 

We live in a world of limited resources. As the world's population continues to grow, it's quality food resources get spread thinner and will continue to grow more necessary and valuable. Leaving the minerals in the ground will also increase their value. 

Large-scale mining in Bristol Bay's headwaters will be a flash in the pan, as all nonrenewable resource extraction is. Inevitably it will either damage or destroy the largest sockeye salmon run in the world. It is not a matter of if, but when. 

Prioritizing a finite resource over, and at the expense of, a renewable resource is a fools errand.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

The potential impacts to the environment and the Pacific salmon runs continue to be severe, and the need to maintain the health of the Bristol Bay ecosystem is critical. 

""Open-pit mines typically contain their byproducts in large dam systems, which have been known to leak or fail. This is precisely what happened at the Mount Polly gold mine in 2014, where a dam failure unleashed about 4.5 billion gallons of water and toxic debris into the surrounding salmon habitat.

Such a disaster, Northern Dynasty is quick to point out, will not happen at Pebble, as modern engineering techniques will be used to prevent any failure. And they're right: the probability of a dam failure is extremely low. But as with any probability, it increases with time. And the EPA report explains that, while all of the gold and copper would be mined out of Pebble in about a century, the waste would need to be maintained 'for centuries and potentially in perpetuity.'""

           Please do not withdraw the July 2014 Proposed determination to restrict mining of the Pebble Deposit.  This area is pristine and too valuable in terms of subsistence fishing and recreational value as well as ecosystem value.  Your mission is to uphold rights of the public need for clean water and air and this withdraw, although possibly required as far as the 404 Army Corps permit process is too dangerous to be allowed.  When human error is possible in any mining or other dangerous activity (radiation refining or nuclear weapons/power generation;  oil drilling in waterways) the next seven generations need to be protected.   This ""Question"" of whether to gut environmental protection aspects which this proposed withdrawal equals is a travesty and is inconsistent with your mission.  
          If the needs of this case is such that the foreign mining interest Trumps the needs of our citizens and environment,  there need to be trade agreement clauses that allow an international tribunal to accurately weigh benefits and risks with deference to traditional people's WAY OF LIFE, HEALTH, SAFETY AND LEVELS OF STRESS -in the event of a dam failure which may not happen immediately, but could very well happen in the near term-- of Alaskans, Canadians and all peoples who depend on fish for their sustainance.  
           In the event that this withdrawal of the July 2014 Proposed Determination to Restrict mining of the Pebble deposit is allowed, I am asking that the Administrator of the EPA and the area administrator replace the determination with a DECISIVE RULE that will protect these valuable waters with the same or more strict protections  as the above proposed determination limits on amount of material able to be disposed in the public domain.
            Thank you for considering seriously all of the comments that are delivered, and also the effect that your decisions will have on your family, descendants and friends, many of whom will depend on resources and recreation that could be decimated if the wrong decisions are made!!

Please do not withdraw the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination, which it made pursuant to the Clean Water Act in 2014.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries, supporting tens of millions of wild running salmon. 
The region support thousands of fisheries and recreation-based jobs that would be jeopardized by using these watersheds as
 a dump for mining waste. 65% of Alaskans and 80% of Bristol Bay residents oppose the proposed Pebble Mine. 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA
step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million 
Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, 
and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of 
a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs. 

Please do not withdraw the proposed determination.

Thank you for you time.

I really hope that reality and facts is the determining factor.  I am all for rational regulation, however opposition to this mine is nothing less than irrational.  When I found out this mine was 90 miles away from the bay I couldn't believe it.  What is all the fuss about?  What about the current existing mines that co-exist with the environment?  

The argument against this mine is not based on reality.  Simple as that.  We need to quit catering to the squeaky wheel.  Are we really considering sacrificing job and economic growth based on a false perception from environmental extremists?  We are in this strange place as a nation where facts do not matter anymore.  All that matters anymore is creating a narrative (real or not) to support what we want to believe to be true.  Enough is enough.  We need to quit apologizing and catering to these people, this isn't how the real world operates.  

Do your analysis.  If there is no significant threat to the salmon habitat, then why on earth would be not let this proceed forward.  If the opposition's only argument are manufactured ""facts"" that are not based in reality, too bad so sad.  It's time for these people to grow up.  Simply saying ""It will be bad for the salmon"" is not an argument.  Lets see the supporting evidence.

Under the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Corps has the authority to grant permits while EPA has only the authority to veto permits.  The CWA does not permit EPA to impose pre-permit (or preemptive) restrictions on development over large areas of land, as EPA has attempted to do in Bristol Bay.

Under Section 404(a), the Corps evaluates a permit application (proposing a specific mine with specific control and mitigation measures) using guidelines it developed in conjunction with EPA and complies with NEPA and regulations developed by the Council on Environmental Quality.  EPA, under 404(c), may then prohibit ""the specification ... of any defined area"" or deny or restrict the use of ""any defined area for specification.""  Thus, EPA cannot act in the absence of a permit application detailing the specification and area of development.

The conduct of EPA over the last 40 years confirms that its issuance of a preemptive veto is unprecedented.  EPA has only exercised its authority under Section 404(c) thirteen times.  In each instance, EPA invoked Section 404(c) only after receipt of a permit application that described the scope and details of the project being proposed, the anticipated environmental impact, and techniques to be employed to mitigate or control that impact.

The House Oversight Committee in 2015 concluded that ""EPA's use of a preemptive veto (at Pebble) was unprecedented and without a legal basis.""  The Committee described EPA's course of action as ""an unprecedented change in the agency's process for regulating resource and development projects,"" and called on EPA to ""cease all preemptive 404(c) activity"" to allow for the normal permitting process to take place. 

Many Alaska industry and trade associations expressed concern about the EPA abandoning the normal process for evaluating projects such as Pebble.  They joined with national trade associations in expressing this concern multiple time.  The rules and the rule of law matter.  Removing the Proposed Determination is an important step in returning fair and due process to the EPA.
Withdrawal of the Proposed Determination will not harm the environment; it only allows PLP to engage in the normal permitting process.

EPA must withdraw its Proposed Determination because it was based on an untested, ad hoc analysis that is not sanctioned by the CWA or NEPA.

Normally, a proposed developer submits a Section 404 CWA permit application to the Corps.  Once the permit application is filed, NEPA requires the Corps to ""take a hard look"" at potential impacts of the development application and prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (""EIS""). 

Rather than waiting for PLP to file a Section 404 permit application, and adhering to the traditional permitting process, EPA commissioned a watershed assessment of the Bristol Bay region - the Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment (""BBWA"").  The BBWA - the scientific analysis underlying the Proposed Determination - was fatally flawed.

The BBWA examines the effects of three hypothetical mining scenarios on salmon fisheries, but none of these hypothetical mining scenarios incorporated industry best practices, and were in fact demonstrably un-permittable under U.S. and Alaska regulations.

The BBWA also largely dismisses the possibility of compensatory mitigation, which would be an obvious and required feature of any robust permit application review process. 

Ruling against a project at the end of an open process that prioritized science and informed decision-making is a possibility every investor faces.  Investors do not expect, however, to be shut out of a contrived, one-sided process from the beginning and informed of the rejection at the end.  That is exactly what EPA did to PLP when it initiated the preemptive veto here 

The harmful effects of continuing with EPA's veto process will go well beyond the mining industry, as 404 permits are required in so many circumstances that they affect every area of our economy.  

The Corps processes approximately 60,000 permits a year, and, according to some estimates, roughly $220 billion of investment per year depends on these permits.  These investors expect regulators to place reasonable restrictions on projects; they typically do not expect regulators to make preemptive decisions based on new policy courses before an application is even submitted.  For the process to be fair, developers must have a full opportunity to present plans, defend science, and modify projects to meet legitimate concerns.  This is good policy; it is also the law.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world and 25 federally recognized tribes who for 4,000 years have depended on the fishery for their subsistence-based culture. The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the project, and a statewide majority of voters also oppose it. The watersheds unique ecological resources generate significant economic benefits and employment. EPAs original watershed assessment was scientifically robust and thoroughly peer-reviewed. That assessment and related public comments should strongly influence any future action.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries, supporting tens of millions of wild running salmon. The region support thousands of fisheries and recreation-based jobs that would be jeopardized by using these watersheds as a dump for mining waste. 65% of Alaskans and 80% of Bristol Bay residents oppose the proposed Pebble Mine.

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs.

I have studied over the last 6 months Northern Dynasty Minerals as a company and the Pebble Limited Partnership. It is very clear to me that they have a substantial asset with a management team, the expertise, and the technology to develop this mine with every consideration towards maintaining a safe and environmentally sound production site.  I understand, how desperately Alaska needs projects like this to help stabilize their economy and contribute both socially and financially to their local communities as well as provide much needed infrastructure. This would be a huge win for the State of Alaska as well as those who invest in the company.

But besides all of the positives this project could bring to Alaska, I believe the EPA clearly took the law into their own hands and this should never be allowed.  The EPA most definitely should withdraw the EPA Region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination that was issued pursuant of the Clean Water Act and give fair and due process to the permitting process.

Impact studies, meetings, and public comment all overwhelmingly agreed that it would be terrible to allow the Bristol Bay mining project to continue.The American people were led to believe that this decision was final, and that the decision to not allow discharge in the watershed was in the interest of the American public. 

The only thing that has changed since the 2014 decision is EPA leadership. Nothing else has changed, and there is absolutely no objective reason that this should be subject to reevaluate. The American people spoke very loud in voicing overwhelming opposition to this project. The ecological impacts are potentially devastating; the economic impacts are potentially devastating; and the political impacts are potentially devastating. 

The only people that stand to benefit from this project are a small group of associates of the new EPA administrator. It's unfathomable that this would be up for reevaluation.

I am writing to request that the EPA reevaluate their decision to withdraw the Clean Water Act enacted to protect one of the most important wild-salmon fisheries in the world. I am completely appalled to find that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt made the this decision just hours after meeting with the CEO of Pebble Limited. This brings into question much suspicion. Additionally why were the results of a 3-year peer reviews study, that concluded that the damage from the coal mine would be irreversible, completely ignored? Who's interests does Mr. Pruitt serving, those of Tom Collier or those of the people? I call for full investigation into this and will be starting a petition immediately. Your actions are completely unreasonable and against common sense. You are risking so much on an a dying energy source which will not even be used past 2030. I am not an activist or an environmentalist, I am just a regular law-abiding, tax-paying citizen who is appalled at the decision Mr. Pruitt has made. It needs to be reversed immediately.

Ultimately, the rule of law needs to be upheld and the Army Corps of Engineers should have the final say on whether the project should go ahead.

Every year there are more cruise ships.  A huge amount of Alaska's income and residents livelihood is dependent on the natural migration of the salmon in this area.  Salmon farms have parasites and don't look healthy.  These wild salmons are the ones served on cruise ships and excursions and sold in vacuum packed packages.  They are the ones tourist come to see running up natural streams.  They are the ones eagles and bear depend on.  

As a CPA, I'm positive the jobs and tax revenue provided by mining this area cannot come close to the tax revenue and jobs generated by tourists and fishing.  Eagles will starve, and bears we currently photograph from a distance will begin to come dangerously  close to people and increase attacks as they come into town looking for food with increasing frequency.

The jobs and tax revenue from mining is finite while tourism, fishing and photographing wildlife goes on in perpetuity.  Once they exhaust the resources, there is nothing but irreversible damage to the habitat.  They can't return to where they were born, they will not spawn, the population of one of the most prolific salmon habitats in the world will ceases to reproduce.  The price of salmon and salmon oil supplements will sky rocket.  Fisherman, tour guides, boat captains, bus drivers, and chefs will be unemployed due to fewer salmon.

Nearly half the world's sockeye salmon comes from Bristol Bay. Given our ever increasing populations, I think it's foolish to do anything to potentially reduce a major food source.

I was in Durango, Colorado when old mining toxins turned the river yellow-orange in 2015. That's the thing. The mine might be safe for some years, but one year it won't be, and the mining company will be long gone when a major disaster happens, leaving the tax payers and a government agency to attempt to undo permanent damage. When no more abandoned mines pollute rivers in the Rockies, I might have more faith in mining companies, but time and time again, they show us they are not worthy of that faith.

Alaska is a seismically active area. Because of that, a lot can go wrong here. 

We get one earth. One. And it needs to sustain life for many, many, many generations. We have to make smart, conservative choices so that future generations may live. I worry that greedy minds are thinking far too short term. Future generations will live with the consequences of this decision forever. 

I strongly oppose disturbing this important salmon ecosystem-- not just because I love eating salmon, and because all living things there depend on salmon, but the livelihoods of thousands of fishermen deserve to be protected too. It is a delicate enough balance without throwing a mine into it.

Restrictions must continue because of several proven facts that all students learn in elementary school. 

1.	Fish eggs and shellfish need sediment-free water to survive. If you bury salmon eggs in sediment they will not get the oxygen it needs to survive. That is why salmon do not bury their eggs in mud banks. Shellfish need oxygen as well and unlike fish, they cannot move if they are covered in sediment.  

2.	Sediment is created by the disruption of the soil combined with a means to transport that soil, namely wind, water, and ice. This process is known as erosion.  

3.	In nature, erosion is limited by plant growth. The foliage slows the rate of water hitting the soil surface and then the roots of the plants help to hold the soil in place acting like a large sponge. This basic balance in known and understood by the vast majority of elementary students across the world. 

4.	Mining is equally easy to understand, you dig a hole to get what is buried underneath. In the process, you create a pile of overburden that you dug out of the hole. The bigger the hole the bigger the pile of overburden.

With these four basic and universally agreed upon facts, it is simple to determine that any mining operation in the watershed of these rivers will create sediment which will be transported by erosion to the watershed which will then cause damage to the surrounding ecosystem. There is no mining system in the world that does not create overburden, erosion, and sedimentation. The question, in this case, is the size and scale of this damage.  

To address the size and scope of the damage comes the next question, ""What is the unacceptable adverse effect?""

Lawyers for the mining company will start to argue that some small percentage of damage is acceptable - who cares about 1 or 2 percent damage to the ecosystem. The moment one allows any concession on the percentage of damage that is acceptable you have lost the argument for all the people and wildlife affected by those changes.   

For example, if there was a 1% change in the number of salmon. Fishermen in the area catch roughly 35 million fish a year, a 1% loss is a drop of 350,000 fish a year which translates into roughly 7 million pounds of salmon. Losing that much salmon is a significant blow both to the local economy and the global food supply as a whole. Looking at the real impact of even slight percentages of damage shows that any damage is an unacceptable adverse effect on someone or something.  

If showing the simple process of soil disruption wasn't enough to demonstrate the importance to keep the restrictions in place there always the toxic chemicals that will be released. These too will cause an unacceptable adverse effect.

The EPA was created to protect and regulate our air, water, and soil, to allow mining lawyers who's interest is not in protecting the environment set the acceptable level of ""adverse effect"" is a disservice to citizens and wildlife of this country. 

EPA please do your duty and keep the restrictions in place.

Thank you for your consideration. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Free markets naturally produce economic activity which, allowed to take there course, maximize economic benefit of a particular resource.  When a resource is abundant and there to be exploited, the free market system will ensure that the resource is converted to economic value with the highest economic efficiency.

In the case of fisheries and other natural resources, this process can be too efficient resulting incremental economic benefit far slighter than the long term consequences of full exploitation of a resource.   That is, free markets are terrible at putting on the brakes and managing, rather than exploiting, a given resource.

My point here is that managing fisheries is required even when they are protected, and fishermen have learned to live with the regulations that ultimately ensure the ongoing availability of the underlying resource.

In the case of Bristol bay, we have a situation where it is not the fishermen that are the threat, but an alternate use of the resource.  This is not a clean water issue, that is a technicality and a loophole.  The direct environmental impact of diverting the estuaries and rivers in which wild salmon spawn could have devastating economic consequences to fishermen, even if one has no empathy for the fish.

There are two important questions to answer here: 1) Is there scientific, peer-reviewed evidence to suggest that Bristol Bay would be negatively impacted, and 2) does the EPA have standing to prevent it.  I believe that the answer in both cases is yes, and therefore the EPA should NOT reverse the scientific conclusion reached over years of study, but continue to soberly apply the law.

The free-market system only works well in the context of well regulated public resources.  We cannot have commerce without policemen.  We cannot have peace without an army.  We cannot have fish without an effective EPA.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I'm writing to oppose the recent EPA decision to lift Mining restrictions placed on Bristol Bay under the Clean Water Act of 1972. Bristol Bay is a pristine natural resource which supports thousands of local fisherman, and should be preserved for future generations in perpetuity.

Copper mining is a notoriously dirty process even with advances in mining technology in recent years. Heavy metals from mining tailings can leach into groundwater and nearby streams, and impact sensitive wildlife: https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/alaska/explore/final-lit-review-amd.pdf .

Other mining operations in Alaska near sensitive environmental areas demonstrate the difficulty in enforcing environmental regulation and holding mining companies accountable for pollution and remediation of natural resources http://juneauempire.com/news/2017-03-05/toxic-water-leaches-prime-alaska-canada-salmon-habitat .

Given the risks associated with open pit mining, the probability of polluting another pristine natural environment is far too great in this case to allow any mining operations in this area. The EPA should pursue all avenues (including legal and regulatory action) to preserve Bristol Bay and other sensitive areas in the US for future generations of Americans.

Aloha,

You should allow a company to do what it needs to do as long as it isn't infringing on anyone else's freedom. Unfortunately, in this case, it seems allowing waste disposal here would hurt the fish population and health. That impacts the fishing businesses in the area, and hurts the people relying on those jobs.  It also infringes on those that just like to fish, though it is hard to determine how much weight to give that. 

Environment concerns aside, the infringement on the rights of citizens outweighs the infringement on the rights of the mine owner. From my perspective, it looks like allowing the mine to be built is the government placing more weight on the rights of the mine owners, arbitrarily choosing them to succeed while they hurt pre-existing businesses. 

 Unless the proposed mine becomes essential to some national security interest, I don't think it should be allowed to be built.

Dear Mr. Pruitt,

As an Alaskan resident, I supported the sensible pro-active measures laid out in the EPA Region 10, July 2014  Determination, pursuant to the Clean Water Act.  At this time I am writing to urge you not to withdraw the EPA Region 10, July 2014 Determination which would prohibit the Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP) access to copper, gold, and molybdenum ore deposits in the watersheds of Bristol Bay.

The advance protection of critical wetlands at the watershed level is a smart step in this area because half of the world's remaining wild sockeye salmon runs come from the Bristol Bay watershed, and these in turn support local resident's existing economies from subsistence to sport and commercial fishing and other vital hunting and fishing tied to the cultural values of the land and waters.

No matter whether the size of the proposed mine, the July 2014 ruling laid out the facts that these remarkable wetlands should not be sacrificed for unavoidable conflict.  It is better to have in place this Determinination, and continue to support it, than to continue the conflict and the waste of state, private, and individual time for a project that would only lead to a boom bust situation and long term degradation of the environment, water quality and the salmon habitats.  
As EPA director you make a legacy decision for generations of Alaskans.  Please keep the July 2014 determination in place.  Do not allow PLP or any entity access to these rich wetland habitats and watershed.

Sincerely,

As a retired water resources specialist, and resident of the Pacific Coast, I am strongly opposed to opening the watersheds of Bristol Bay to mining. I specifically object to the current EPA proposal to withdraw the July 2014 Proposed Determination to restrict the discharge of dredged or fill material associated with the potential ""Pebble Mine"" in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed.  

Land use changes in the lower 48 states have been major contributors to the dramatic decline of the salmon fishery in the Pacific Ocean, adding sediment and pollutants to rivers and streams in which these fish spawn. This has led to severe restrictions on commercial and sport salmon fishing along the US west coast, with economic ripple effects through fishing communities.  

In 2014, the EPA conducted a thorough risk assessment of the potential impacts of large-scale mining on Bristol Bay's world-class commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries as well as on the native Alaskan peoples whose culture is strongly rooted in the fishing tradition. On the basis of this evaluation, they proposed to restrict discharge of dredged or fill material, pursuant to the Clean Water Act.  This is a rational conclusion, protective of the natural resources of this vast watershed, and of the interests of future generations of Native Alaskans.    

Please stand behind the science and recommendations represented by the EPA's 2014 Proposed Determination.  There is no compelling reason to allow large mining companies to profit at the expense of the public trust.  Opening the permitting door has no clear beneficial outcome to the parties involved.

protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon.
The proposed determination was made at the request of local communities
and adopted only after years of rigorous scientific study, public
participation and peer review. The EPA was correct in 2014 when it
found that the Pebble Mine would have ""significant and
unacceptable adverse effects"" on ""one of the most productive,
pristine, valuable and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America
today.""
The EPA has noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300
million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon,
generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon support not only the commercial
and sportfishing industries, but a traditional Native way of life that
has endured for millennia and thrives today.
The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and take all
necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

2) The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world.
3) The watershed is home to 25 federally recognized tribal governments who have maintained a salmon-based culture and subsistence-based way of life for at least 4,000 years that would be placed in jeopardy.
4) The watershed's ecological resources generated nearly $480 million in direct economic expenditures and sales and provided employment for over 14,000 full- and part-time workers in 2009.4

5) The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the project. A statewide majority of voters also oppose it, as evidenced by the 2014 State-wide ballot measure.
6) The rationale for the proposed withdrawal is flawed. Finalizing the proposed determination would provide much more regulatory certainty than withdrawing it, and a permit application is not needed to augment the factual record.

I urge you to not withdraw the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination, which it made pursuant to the Clean Water Act in 2014.

I was fortunate to recently visit Bristol Bay, Alaska, one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. I spent a significant amount of money to visit Katmai National Park to view wildlife (coastal brown bears) and experience the salmon run. This is an important, sustainable form of the tourist industry and I hope that many more people can experience this pristine wilderness.

Further, Bristol Bay is critical for the fishing industry and local jobs. millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans, millions of tourist who visit Alaska to view wildlife and experience wilderness, and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs. 

Please do not withdraw the proposed determination.

Thank you for your consideration.

We are writing to express our opposition to the EPA's May 2017 settlement agreement with Pebble Partnership, a subsidiary of Northern Dynasty Mining Company.   The EPA determined back in 2014 that the Clean Water Act prohibited this  type of project proposed for Bristol Bay.  Despite this conclusion, in May of 2017 the EPA agreed to a settlement with Northern Dynasty Mining Company.  In a nutshell, the settlement terms were as follows: Northern Dynasty would drop the lawsuits it filed against the EPA in exchange for the EPA agreeing to withdraw its regulatory conclusion that Northern Dynasty Mining Company's proposed mining operation violated the Clean Water Act.  The public was not allowed to engage, comment, or otherwise take part in the settlement, which was negotiated behind closed doors.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt heralded the settlement, noting that while the EPA was ""committed to due process and the rule of law... [the settlement would] help steer EPA away from costly and time-consuming litigation...""  Yet Mr. Pruitt's assertion completely contradicts due process and the rule of law.  The EPA made its Clean Water Act ruling in 2014, prompting Northern Dynasty Mining Company to immediately file suit, as Northern Dynasty Mining Company was entitled to do.  But now, the EPA is allowing Northern Dynasty Mining Company to submit its permit despite the EPA having already determined the proposed mine would violate the Clean Water Act.  In effect, the EPA's settlement completely nullifies due process and the rule of law, which dictate that the matter is settled vis--vis the Administrative Agency (the EPA) and the Northern Dynasty Mining Company.  If the Northern Dynasty Mining Company wants to fight the EPAs's ruling, they should do so through the Judicial Branch.  

 In 2016, Donald Trump ran on a pledge to put America first.  Yet nothing could be more antithetical to putting Americans first than allowing foreign profiteers to bypass the Clean Water Act and imperil Bristol Bay's unparalleled salmon fishery, which accounts for over 14,000 American jobs.  As a result, we request that the EPA not agree to this settlement.

The function of the EPA is to protect the environment, not corporate America. I am from Ohio and have vivid recollections of the river of fire, i.e, the days the Cuyahoga River caught fire and burned because of the terrible pollution. It's not a coincidence that the EPA came into existence shortly thereafter.

Alaska is a tremendous resource for this country and even the world. It is one of the last pristine places and should be treated as such. I have great faith in the idea that the scientists working in the EPA during the Obama administration undertook the study of this issue with due diligence and returned the correct decision. Why would the EPA now go back? 

Bristol Bay is one of the most important salmon fisheries in the world. That's a fact. That fishery generates 14,000 jobs. That matters. So does the continued health of the fishery. Certainly that's more important to Alaska, the U.S. and humanity than a copper mine that will blight the pristine landscape and, potentially, kill the fishery with its run off.

It is not worth the risk

Here is a quote from the CNN article. I hope you have the common decency to govern for the people, not the corporations. 

'Within hours of meeting with a mining company CEO, the new head of the US Environmental Protection Agency directed his staff to withdraw a plan to protect the watershed of Bristol Bay, Alaska, one of the most valuable wild salmon fisheries on Earth, according to interviews and government emails obtained by CNN.

The meeting between EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Tom Collier, CEO of Pebble Limited Partnership, took place on May 1, Collier and his staff confirmed in an interview with CNN. At 10:36 a.m. that same day, the EPA's acting general counsel, Kevin Minoli, sent an email to agency staff saying the administrator had ""directed"" the agency to withdraw an Obama-era proposal to protect the ecologically valuable wetland in southwest Alaska from certain mining activities.
In 2014, after three years of peer-reviewed study, the Obama administration's EPA invoked a rarely used provision of the Clean Water Act to try to protect Bristol Bay after finding that a mine ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of the bay.
""All of these losses would be irreversible,"" the agency said.'

The EPA first and foremost is required under the Clean Water Act to protect the nations waters. Both for their ecological value and economic value. The Bristol Bay area is ""home to more than 20 fish species, 190 bird species, and more than 40 terrestrial mammal species, including bears, moose, and caribou"". It's also the largest stockeye salmon run in the world producing 480 million dollars in economic benefit and 14,000 jobs each year. Allowing an exception from the Clean Water Act at Bristol Bay will not only destroy this environment and industry it will impact the people who call this area home, including 31 local tribes. 

The assessment is clear, the degradation of this area resulting from mining operations and waste disposal will be permanent, irreversible, and detrimental. If the EPA's decisions are to be based on solid science they must follow the suggestions of the research that has been done.

In regards to following ""the rule of law"" by allowing the withdrawal of this proposal, as the EPA's Scott Pruitt has claimed, the proposed determination is not outside the realm of the EPA. ""The Clean Water Act generally requires a permit under Section 404 from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before any person places dredge or fill material into wetlands, lakes and streams.  Mining operations typically involve such activities and must obtain Clean Water Act Section 404 permits. Section 404 directs EPA to develop the environmental criteria the Army Corps uses to make permit decisions. It also authorizes EPA to prohibit or restrict fill activities if EPA determines such actions would have unacceptable adverse effects on fishery areas, shellfish beds, water supplies, wildlife, or recreational areas"". Mining actions in Bristol Bay have been determined to have unacceptable adverse effects and thus should not be considered.

Finally, this issue concerns me directly as a citizen of this country where the profits of companies are considered before sound science and those that will be directly impacted. 

Thank you for your time,

Helen Siegel

Mining in this area will lead to irrevocable decline and eventual destruction of the sockeye habitat.

And no US citizen will benefit except Scott Pruitt and a handful of rich mining bosses.

The EPA should repeat a scientific study of the potential impacts of mining, logging and road building in the Pebble Deposit Area.

The damage to the environement does not justify any short-term benefit ... which will mostly accrue to the mining company, not to the state of Alaska and its residents.  The jobs and tax revenue from mining is finite while tourism, fishing and photographing wildlife goes on in perpetuity.  Once they exhaust the resources, there is nothing but irreversible damage to the habitat.  They can't return to where they were born, they will not spawn, the population of one of the most prolific salmon habitats in the world will ceases to reproduce.

Environmental Protection Agency:


During the State of Alaska Frank Murkowski administration (2002 - 2006) the Alaska state government engaged in a process described as the 2005 Bristol Bay Area Plan in order to determine the designation of state lands, among them the lands that include the Bristol Bay river headwaters.  While these lands are obviously critical habitat for fisheries, Governor Murkowski and his commissioner of natural resources made sure that the chosen designation made these lands open to future development.   This ideologically driven decision was widely seen as a misuse of power and the Nondalton Tribal Council, leading a coalition of 5 village councils, Trout Unlimited, and The Alaska Fisherman's Marketing Association sued to reverse the decision and initiate a new process of determination.  (State, Dept. of Natural Resources v. Nondalton Tribal Council (1/20/2012) sp-6638)
In this they were not successful as the Alaska Supreme Court sided with administrative power on what amounts to a technicality and against the local area people.  This event set the stage for the Pebble controversy because if the Bristol Bay uplands had the habitat designation they should have had, mining would never have been on the table in the first place.

Now for some years a number of companies with varying degrees of financial backing have been doing small-bore drill analysis of the mineral deposits and outlining an open pit and deep rock mining proposal primarily for copper in the Bristol Bay uplands.  Seeking to defend their lands, the last remaining world class sockeye fishery,  and their way of life, a group of villages asked the EPA to do an analysis of the situation and the land and waters with a view to obtaining a designation that would do what the Murkowski administration should have done in the first place, namely to protect critical habitat.    Many voices joined in the discussion, or the confrontation if you want, and as these voices became more frustrated by corporate legal tactics and conservative political maneuvering, they were told to be patient and trust the process.   ""There is a process, just hang in and trust the process.""   This advice came from the Congressional offices of both Begich and Murkowski.  (Same name, definitely related.) After tens of thousands of hours of travel, testimony, public meetings, and following the process, the EPA came to a determination under the clean water act and proposed a designation and rule regarding dumping in the Bristol Bay river systems that would prevent the Pebble Mine and other mines from being developed.   So hats off to you Senators Murkowski, Begich, and now Sullivan, the process you impressed upon us worked and we got protection for the Bay.  

Except for one little remaining maneuver.  A new federal administration and a new EPA commissioner have informed us that we just need to start over.  The old process: all the testimony, all the statements, all the science, all the meetings from Seattle to Bristol Bay: it turns out it was all smoke and mirrors.  We were told to trust something that ghosted through our fingers and became nothing.  We can trust the new process though, right?  

To this new public process I submit all the testimony, all the science, all the petitions, all the process documentation that went before, amounting to some ten years of work by civic groups, by government agencies, and by scientists of different stripes.  Based on the substance of this process the EPA came to a decision and that is the only acceptable decision that can be concluded now.  Any other decision than the one already reached makes liars out of the congressional delegation who knew full well that the 'process' could and would be manipulated to achieve a pro-industrial development agenda. If the EPA does not verify and certify the decision it already reached, it constitutes a massive betrayal of the people and the process we were told to trust.  Any other decision is incontestable evidence that the current administration is in fact not a government but is instead the creature of a self serving and ideologically driven private agenda, determined to manipulate the mechanics of government for its own ends.  Any other decision than the one made to defend the Bristol Bay uplands under the clean water act is a defacto declaration of war on the people and their sacred lands and waters.

As a citizen of these great lands, I cannot in good conscious support or understand your proposed action to allow dredge and disposal waste from the Pebble Mine on Bristol Bay. The wastes associated with mining will destroy the livelihoods if contaminant levels of copper, molybdenum and heavy metals introduced into the bay are significant. This appears to be what the EPA desires as its administrators and Direktor (spelling intentional) have agreed with Pebble Limited to not regulate and protect the pristine environment that is Alaska. The fishermen and surrounding community who rely on this traditional export and livelihood will be prevented from exporting the salmon if caught, due to contamination, and likely destruction of the natural habitat of Bristol Bay, Lliamna Lake, and surrounding rivers. 

I urge you to do your sworn duty and protect the environment and people of these United States.

When the EPA illegally shut down Pebble's opportunity to move forward with permitting, the government showed its willingness to be 'above the law' in quite unprecedented though not surprising ways. 'Protecting the environment' sounds like a noble cause, just like when the tag line 'its for the children' is added to some piece of legislation. Well if it saves the earth or the lives of children, how can it be questioned? If you have traveled to Nicaragua, the wealthiest country in Latin America in terms of natural resources, and compare its economy to Costa Rica, its neighbor to the south, also compare what happens to the children when a government withholds a countries' natural resources from the people who actually should receive the benefits. A government that allows its people to reap the rewards of their own natural resources provides opportunities for the economy to grow and children to be taken care of for generations. A government that doesn't is destroying opportunities for its people to grow economically and enjoy personal freedoms that make life the blessing that it should be. Who owns the land Pebble is on? A governmental bureaucracy in Washington? A government 'for the people, by the people' doesn't impoverish its people with its own self-serving platitudes. And while we are saving the environment with electric cars, a noble cause, let's also ask how much copper EACH of those cars requires to operate. The Toyota Prius requires 64 pounds! Where will that copper come from and which countries' children will reap the benefit of having found and sold that copper? I don't believe that environmental health and the prosperity of a country have to always be in a battle with each other. Let's take a look at the $150 million dollar research which has already been spent on Pebble's environmental impact studies, and see if there is a way to help an area of our country desperate for economic development while maintaining an amazing and beautiful environment. If the rule of law is to be maintained, there is no question that Pebble should be allowed to move forward with a process that only guarantees fairness and objectivity, allowing the people of Bristol Bay to clearly assess the decisions they alone should be making.

The communities and ecosystem that will be affected by this mine are rich in culture and biodiversity. 

The salmon populations that call these possibly affected watersheds home are important to the entire ecosystem in Southwestern Alaska and watersheds downstream. The salmon feed all predators and scavengers in the areas of the watersheds. They also feed the surrounding ecosystem with nutrient from their carcasses as they spawn in the waterways. These salmon are also massive food source and culturally important for the people that call the watershed areas home. They are also economically important to not only those people that live within the watersheds, but for the entire State of Alaska. 
Both the science from the 2014 Proposed Determination findings and my personal beliefs agree that the economic revenue and jobs that this mine can create, cannot possibly outweigh the cultural and ecosystem significance of the watersheds that will be involved of the proposed Pebble Mine.

Please do not allow the Pebble Mine to make irrevocable harm.

Alaska should have the Pebble Mine which can exist along with the Salmon Fisheries. Just south, in the Canadian province of BC, several producing Gold and other mines exist with a vibrant salmon industry. This has been going on for years with mines much closer to salmon and spawning, than the pebble mine is to the Bristol Bay Salmon runs, all coexisting with no fish destruction. These mines were built with older technology than those being proposed for the Pebble mine. These newer technologies should make the Pebble mine the safest to be built to date. The mine will add decent high paying jobs to the area. The infrastructure built for the project will provide affordable electricity for Southwest Alaska allowing the local fish industry to receive larger profits for the sale of their salmon. I believe America will also require more copper, gold, silver and moly coming from their own land rather than sourcing these vital resources on the world market.

Dear Pirzadeh or to whom it may concern, 
I would like to register my concern for the possible removal of reviews and restrictions currently in place for the proposed Pebble mine. I feel that this focus on natural resource extraction in a sensitive area is very shortsighted and detrimental. any gain due to short term job creation or wealth generated by resource extraction from the pebble mine will be offset many times over by the environmental and economic damages wrought on the surrounding communities that depend on the waters all the way down to the Salmon fisheries of Bristol bay. Like so many extraction operations this will benefit a few already rich individuals at the long term expense of the already undeserved communities in the surrounding area.  Please don't allow yourself to be pressured by outside money, stick up for the people who you are supposed to represent. 

Thank you for reading this message.

It saddens me that the 'rule of law' should be up for debate in a country that was founded on the law being supreme over its leaders rather than vice versa. When the EPA illegally shut down Pebble's opportunity to move forward with permitting, the government showed its willingness to be 'above the law' in quite unprecedented though not surprising ways. 'Protecting the environment' sounds like a noble cause, just like when the tag line 'its for the children' is added to some piece of legislation. Well if it saves the earth or the lives of children, how can it be questioned? If you have traveled to Nicaragua, the wealthiest country in Latin America in terms of natural resources, and compare its economy to Costa Rica, its neighbor to the south, also compare what happens to the children when a government withholds a countries' natural resources from the people who actually should receive the benefits. A government that allows its people to reap the rewards of their own natural resources provides opportunities for the economy to grow and children to be taken care of for generations. A government that doesn't is destroying opportunities for its people to grow economically and enjoy personal freedoms that make life the blessing that it should be. Who owns the land Pebble is on? A governmental bureaucracy in Washington? A government 'for the people, by the people' doesn't impoverish its people with its own self-serving platitudes. And while we are saving the environment with electric cars, a noble cause, let's also ask how much copper EACH of those cars requires to operate. The Toyota Prius requires 64 pounds! Where will that copper come from and which countries' children will reap the benefit of having found and sold that copper? I don't believe that environmental health and the prosperity of a country have to always be in a battle with each other. Let's take a look at the $150 million dollar research which has already been spent on Pebble's environmental impact studies, and see if there is a way to help an area of our country desperate for economic development while maintaining an amazing and beautiful environment. If the rule of law is to be maintained, there is no question that Pebble should be allowed to move forward with a process that only guarantees fairness and objectivity, allowing the people of Bristol Bay to clearly assess the decisions they alone should be making",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

 Land use changes in the lower 48 states have been major contributors to the dramatic decline of the salmon fishery in the Pacific Ocean, adding sediment and pollutants to rivers in which these fish spawn. This has led to severe restrictions on commercial and sport salmon fishing along the US west coast, with economic ripple effects through fishing communities.

 In 2014, the EPA conducted a thorough risk assessment of the potential impacts of large-scale mining on Bristol Bay's world-class commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries as well as on the native Alaskan peoples whose culture is strongly rooted in the fishing tradition. On the basis of this evaluation, they proposed to restrict discharge of dredged or fill material, pursuant to the Clean Water Act.

 The current Director of the EPA seeks to reverse this decision. This action would be a terrible mistake, with impacts not only to the fishery itself, but to the many fishermen (including Native Americans) and to the entire ecosystem based on salmon-derived nutrients.

 Opening the door to the Pebble Mine would be the only the beginning of a disastrous crash in the Alaskan salmon fishery and all those that depend on it. We've done this already in the lower 48 states. Let's learn from the past, and keep the July 2014 Proposed Determination in place.""

The prospect of a hardrock mineral mining operation as such gargantuan proportions as envisioned by Northern Dynasty would devastate an exquisitely sensitive watershed and the rich productivity of aquatic life, capped by a salmon population of awesome fecundity. The food chain of Bristol Bay is inextricably dependent upon a watershed that yields a reliably low sediment, high-oxygen water supply. The proposed mining operation would disfigure and transform the watershed, with a sprawling network of infrastructure bleeding sediment at every rain, exposed ore seams that shed acidic runoff, and large pits that interrupt the subterranean movement of water.
 
Bristol Bay epitomizes the aquatic resources that EPA was entrusted to protect through the Clean Water Act 404(c) review process, and it has done so correctly. You have a sacred moral obligation, as well as a legal responsibility as EPA Administrator, to protect this priceless of vital aquatic ecosystem. The Clean Water Act enshrines Americas determination that certain levels of aquatic ecosystem destruction are unacceptable, and the transparent, scientifically rigorous process conducted by EPA found correctly that Bristol Bay epitomizes this category.
 
Bristol Bay salmon support thousands of fishermen from across Alaska, the west coast, and other parts of the nation who descend on this remote and pristine region every summer to harvest the ""red gold.""  The fishery represents a multi-million dollar industry whose impact is felt across the country. Salmon are also the life-blood of local village economies and support centuries old subsistence traditions of the Native cultures in western Alaska. The compelling, overriding importance of Bristol bays intact ecosystem is illustrated by the support for EPAs finding among both Native and Anglo Alaskans, who traditionally and well-disposed to resource development, but correctly recognized the singular importance of Bristol Bay.
 
This ecosystem is a priceless treasure; the minerals and the trinkets they would be used to manufacture are not. Even if EPA limits its analysis to a mere utilitarian calculation of economic productivity, no question exists that maintaining the salmon production is more valuable than any mineral extraction. Any dilution or repeal of the prior administrations Clean Water Act finding would be a gross miscarriage and abdication of your responsibility.

I am opposed to EPAs proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Joseph A. Benucci, a resident of Alaska.  This is NOT a form letter.  This is NOT a ""bot.""  This is not a cyber attack.  This is a father, an Alaskan, a Military veteran with 21+ years of service, AND a conservationist, writing to you to tell you that your attempt to withdraw clean water act determination for the proposed Pebble mine, which your own agency determined would cause great harm to Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon runs, local fishery, and Native communities, is a bad deal for ALL Alaskans!

Bristol Bay is home to the most productive salmon ecosystem in the world.  It supports more than 14,000 American jobs and is valued at more than $1.5 billion annually.  While I know you think you are doing something good for the American economy, what you're really doing is destroying a way of life in Alaska, and potentially harming the worlds LAST great Salmon run.  Please, do not do what Russia has done.  Please do not do what dictators in Argentina and Chile have done.  Please, do not put short-term mineral extraction profits over the renewable resource of Salmon provided by mother nature.  

After years of rigorous study, I think you agency proposed science-based restrictions on the Pebble mine. Even with a scaled back mine, if you believe Pebble LLC's (ask yourself, why are they an LLC?) recent updated press release, the mine has the potential to be the largest open pit ever constructed in North America and generate billions of tons of dangerous waste, including antimony, arsenic, copper, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, zinc, and sulfate.  YOUR own scientist and independent subject experts agree, to store mine waste, there will need to be miles of dams reaching up to 740 feet high (that's taller than your building in DC by a factor of 10) to hold back what is essentially poison.  I don't know if you've ever been to Alaska, or know that the largest earthquake in North American history struck here on Good Friday a few years back, but the region's seismic activity and extreme weather conditions could trigger catastrophic dam failures.  Your recent move to reverse course and cut a deal with Northern Dynasty Minerals against the will of nearly two-thirds of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen, strike of DC arrogance you are so quick to accuse your predecessors of.  For over 16 years, Alaska Native Tribes and commercial fishing business owners have been advocating against this toxic mega-mine. The EPA itself has hosted dozens of community meetings and conducted a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. In addition, more than 1.5 million Americans wrote to the EPA asking for strong protections for Bristol Bay.

While the mining company has said it will introduce plans for a smaller mine. It frankly doesn't matter, whatever size, pebble mine's infrastructure would include a network of roads, pipelines, a port, and an energy-generating station which will impact where our Alaska salmon fry grow prior to leaving for the Pacific Ocean.  Once established, this infrastructure could lead to the development of a mining district many times larger than the original Pebble mine lease with devastating consequences for the Bristol Bay watershed and local people.  I urge you to listen to the voices of local communities and businesses, joined by hundreds of thousands of people in Alaska and across the United States who oppose this dangerous mega-mine.
Don't put the interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs and keep the EPA's Clean Water Act protections for Bristol Bay in place.

I am writing you today to ask that you stand with American jobs and communities and not withdraw the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination, which it made pursuant to the Clean Water Act in 2014.

As you know, Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs. 

Please do not withdraw the proposed determination.

Thank you.

The environmental risks posed by allowing mining to proceed in this watershed are substantial, regardless of company claims to the contrary.  These risks have unfortunately been born out in the form of real impacts in countless watersheds throughout the country.  One only needs to look at the numerous Superfund sites, or the recent mining impacts that have been in the news, to get a feel for what's at stake here.  For additional site-specific details on these examples, please refer to the comment letter submitted by my professional society - the American Fisheries Society.

While I support the concept of business profits, I would ask that the EPA weigh the costs and benefits of a mining development scenario vs those of a fully protected, functioning watershed.  In the Pebble Mine scenario, profits (minerals) would be made by a one-time extractive process, that leaves behind a potentially devastating legacy of post mining impacts.  In the protected watershed scenario, profits (salmon harvest) would be made annually and in perpetuity, with no environmental risk or negative legacy.

As a restoration specialist in the lower 48, we no longer have the functioning watersheds at the scale of Bristol Bay.  While none of the extractive industries partially responsible for this situation set out to intentionally degrade these systems, we simply did not understand the consequences of our actions in time.   Now that we do understand the cause and effect relationships of these industries -we should utilize that information to make more informed choices.  A fully functioning watershed with all 5 species of wild, naturally produced Pacific Salmon is an amazingly rare resource, and one worthy of permanent protection.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

I am writing to ask that you not approve Pebble Limited Partnership's application to mine gold and minerals in Bristol Bay. The health of the nation and our children depends on responsible and earth-first decision making. Further, closing the bay to mining would also be pro-business as it would support the Bay's multi-million dollar salmon fishing industry. Making sure that chemicals and harmful machinery are unable to reach fish and pollute the bay's waters is paramount to keeping the salmon thriving. 

In addition, chemicals that enter the water would harm the environment overall, reaching birds and other aquatic species, and, of course, humans. So many of America's waters, iconic ones like the Hudson River, have already been polluted by a number of different industries. When business is put over the health of the land and the people who depend on it, these things happen. 


I ask that you look at the wild fires in California, the hurricanes that ravaged Texas, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, and consider whether our environment can bear yet another blow at the hands of humans. And if being pro-business is still more important in your eyes, consider the hundreds of millions of dollars fishers, grocers, and restaurants produce thanks to the thriving salmon population in Bristol Bay. It is important to protect that business and the consumers who eat the fish that Pebble Limited Partnership's project would sicken. Please make the only responsible decision here and deny the application.

Thank You.

I am writing to express my opposition to the US EPA's decision to withdraw Clean Water Act restrictions in regards to the Pebble Mine proposed for the Bristol Bay watershed. I have participated in instream fish surveys and habitat assessments in all three of the watersheds in question: Upper Talarik Creek as well as the North and South Fork Koktuli River (The Nature Conservancy 2010). Additionally, I have assisted with fish surveys in downstream and neighboring watersheds. During these surveys, my colleagues and I found fish in nearly 90% of the small tributaries and salmon in nearly 75% of each waterbody that we sampled.  Based upon this first hand experience as well as extensive additional study of the region, I agree with US EPA original watershed assessment's decision. 

This mine is incompatible with the long term health of the natural, renewable resources of the region and therefore incompatible with the long term health of the region's people. A mine of Pebble's scale would require water treatment and facility maintenance in perpetuity.  The mining industry in Alaska as in so many other states cannot identify large scale mines that have been properly closed in a safe and environmentally sound manner.  Examples of abandoned mines with lingering environmental problems in Alaska include the Platinum and Red Devil mines.  

I grew up going fishing with my grandfather and uncles in Pennsylvania coal country. Despite streams that were often crystal clear, we usually had trouble finding any fish especially trout.  The reason that the streams were so clear is the same one that there were no fish, acid mine drainage. I do not want to leave such a legacy for my own child or generations of Alaskans to follow me.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I have been an Alaska resident for 35 years and I resoundingly reject the concept of a ""safe"" mine with completely unproven technology to ensure environmental protection for the salmon producing watersheds and estuaries in the Bristol Bay region in perpetuity.

	The Proposed Determination of July 2014, to restrict discharge of dredge and fill materials at the proposed Pebble Mine, should not be withdrawn. The proposed determination will uphold the Clean Water Act's legal requirements.
	Dumping earth overburden mine tailings or dredged and fill material into fish-bearing waters is a death-sentence for fish, if not all aquatic species. Mines are notorious for degrading water quality in the United States and throughout many other countries.
	Some of Bristol Bays critical watersheds are in the proposed mine areas of Koktuli River and Talarik Creek. Discharging mine waste, etc. into these waterways is irresponsible and a direct threat to the fishery. 
	I am a retired Bristol Bay commercial fisherman, and derived my livelihood from this and other Alaskan fisheries for years. Every year, thousands of commercial, subsistence, and sport fishermen and fisherwomen harvest the Bay's fish for both food and livelihood. 
	Mine development would require the development of the equivalent of a city in the headwaters. There are quite enough towns and villages in the Bristol Bay region at present. They serve both the permanent residents and the summer fishermen well. This new city would have an enormous footprint with water and sewer discharges, air pollution, fuel emissions, and all the rest. Loss of habitat would be widespread.
	Four major global mining companies have pulled out of this fiasco knowing it is not going to succeed either environmentally or financially. Many mines typically run until bankruptcy, then they are left to ooze toxic waste into Rivers for decades with no one to pick up the tab for clean-up.
	Conclusion: EPA's proposed determination should stand and should not be changed or withdrawn.

Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems. Your a horrible leader and don't belong in such a profound and important position.

As EPA Administrator Pruitt and his staff well-know: After three years of peer-reviewed study, the Obama administration's EPA invoked a provision of the Clean Water Act to protect Bristol Bay after finding that a mine ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of the bay. ""All of these losses would be irreversible,"" the agency said. The area is regarded as one of the world's most important salmon fisheries, producing nearly half of the world's annual sockeye salmon catch. Its ecological resources also support 4,000-year-old indigenous cultures, as well as about 14,000 full- and part-time jobs, according to the EPA's 2014 report.

This project must not move forward as the pollution and environmental destruction would be a catastrophe for the communities and wildlife of Bristol Bay. In fact, the Pebble Mine would turn this unspoiled wilderness into a toxic wasteland for decades to come. For these reasons, please do not withdraw the proposal to restrict the use of this area as a disposal site.

Please do not allow this project to move forward, for the good of the American people -- the general public and their grandchildren-- that you serve.

I submit this letter in response to the proposal to withdraw the EPA's July 2014 Clean Water Act determination to restrict the use of certain waters as disposal sites for material associated with the proposed Pebble mine in Alaska. I am extremely concerned by the possibility that the Pebble mine will be allowed to move forward, and that it would result in catastrophic environmental and economic damage to the Bristol Bay region in Alaska and American fisheries.

It is apparent that the current administration probably cares little for the ecological value of Bristol Bay, so I'm going to focus on the economic benefits of Bristol Bay's sockeye salmon fishery. Roughly half of the world's sockeye salmon catch is from Bristol Bay and its tributaries, and the Bristol Bay salmon fishery is worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually ($300 million in 2009 as per the EPA's own website). The sum of indirect benefits of the Bristol Bay fishery are astounding - $1.5 billion in 2010. The Bristol Bay fishery also employs >11,000 workers each year. This is ten-times the number of workers the PLP would employ at the Pebble mine operation (1,000 employees for the first 20 to 25 years of the project). Thus the Bristol Bay salmon fishery represents a more consistent economic boon to a greater number of workers in the region. I would also add that the relative value of Bristol Bay salmon is likely to increase. With climate change, it is likely that the proportion of the world's sockeye salmon that is from Bristol Bay will increase as productivity of British Columbian sockeye decreases (namely from the Fraser River watershed). Aside from sockeye salmon, our American fisheries are more likely to increase dependence on Bristol Bay for other salmon species such as Chinook, chum, coho, and pink salmon, as their productivity in the Pacific northwest of the contiguous US continues to decline. 

I also strongly caution against assumptions or wishful thinking that the Pebble mine project could coexist with the salmon fishery. Sockeye salmon are highly adapted to their environment and sensitive to changes in water condition. Several closely related species (in both Oncorhynchus and Salmo genera) have been shown to avoid or even be physiologically impaired by low concentrations of heavy metal contamination. The Bristol Bay fishery is so productive because of the pristine conditions of its watersheds and tributaries. Any failure to keep mining byproducts out of salmon-rearing watersheds would be catastrophic with immediate and likely long-lasting economic losses to the region. I am not optimistic that the Pebble mine project could guarantee against catastrophic failures, particularly given the instability of the geology in the region (e.g. earthquake prone).

Lastly, I implore the agency to listen to the public on this matter, and to follow the desires of constituents rather than large commercial industries. A series of polls in the region (including independent ones conducted by the Hays Research Group, Dittman, and the BBNC) have demonstrated that the public is in favor of prohibiting the Pebble mine project, often by substantial margins.

In short, the Pebble mine project does not make economic nor environmental sense, and is not wanted by the public.

Sincerely,

Nathan B. Furey, PhD

Unregulated disposal can only lead to a degraded environment upon which all life, human and animal, depends for its sustenance, a consideration that I am aware means almost nothing to an administration that seems indifferent to science and environmental integrity. 

I remember a time when some of our waterways were so polluted that they caught fire. Please don't return the United States to an era of unregulated waste disposal. One of the things that makes our country great is the quality of life afforded its citizens, a quality that is directly a consequence of a healthy, functioning ecosystem.

If you look at where salmon runs exist, they are only places where the habitat has not been degraded by humans.  Bristol Bay is the most productive salmon run on Earth.  Why would anyone consider endangering this for another gold mine.  The US has plenty of gold, money, industry, etc.  It does not have plenty of salmon.  You can eat salmon, you can't eat gold.  The economic priority must be long term sustainability and not short term profit.  Developing this mine flies in the face of reason.

While I understand Scott Pruitt was hired to actively destroy the environment, and has turned the EPA into a weapon against common sense, I still hope there are people within the agency willing to stand up for what is right in this world. The Proposed mine in Southwest Alaska would not be a job creator (actually, it would put a lot of people out of work), and is simply a capitulation to money grabbing tycoons who are taking advantage of a weak administration to line their pockets. 

No matter if he gets re-elected, this mine will be there long after Trump. Please think about the damage it would cause in the long-run. I am from Montana and I grew up near Butte. There is a giant mine in the city that is the result of wanton environmental destruction nearly a century ago. 

It still creates water problems in the city and affects the lives of residents even in 2017. 

Don't destroy this land because ""we feel like it"". 

I hope this letter finds someone in the EPA so you can realise that we, the people, are watching. While it may not get the sexy headlines of other issues, these are the type of proposals that get passed around quietly. Please do you job and stop this mine from being built. 

Thanks,

1) Most importantly I believe the EPA should ABSOLUTELY NOT withdraw the July 2014 Proposed Determination at this time for the reasons stated above. I believe the reasons above are not sufficient reason to withdraw the proposal (as a settlement would not have altered the reasons the determination was reached in the first place - that is, the science and the reasons for protecting the land HAVE NOT CHANGED and if it was a bad idea to use the location as a dump site in the past it is a bad idea to use it as one now).

2) If a final withdrawal decision is made following this comment period, the Administrator should ABSOLUTELY review and reconsider the withdrawal decision. As I have said above - all evidence points to the dumping of waste at this location being environmentally destructive, and in particular devastating to the local sockeye salmon population. Any protections the EPA can issue concerning this area - particularly the current ones that preclude the Army Corps of Engineers from issuing a permit to dump waste in this location - must continue.

3) I understand that a settlement was reached and that the organization feels they must follow through with it. However, the settlement and the terms of it were not something that appears to be sufficiently reviewed - and that preserving the genetic diversity of a species (which in turn preserves valuable biodiversity that can never be regained if lost) is far more valuable than whatever economic consequences might develop from not following through with the settlement, or whatever might be lost if Pebble Limited Partnership once again sued.

4) This entire process of commenting has felt designed to inhibit public comment on this issue through excessive use of legalese, separating documents, and language discouraging a discussion of the science involved. An argument on the reasons NOT to allow PLP to apply for an Army Corps of Engineers permit to dump waste in this location (which they will almost certainly do, and which will almost certainly be approved - particularly without the EPA encouraging the Army Corps not to allow the permit) MUST involve discussion of what the science is, and how it has not changed. The idea that one can discuss environmental regulation without reference to the science involved is, quite frankly, appalling and demonstrates a certain duplicity on the part of the individuals attempting to drive this decision to withdraw the July 2014 Proposed Determination.

No research since that date has shown that mining would benefit salmon. The proposed rollback of the restrictions is inconsistent with science. A mine would threaten the Bristol Bay region and economy and might devastate commercial and recreational salmon fishing. The headwaters of the Bristol Bay region sustains the world's largest sockeye salmon runs, and risking these waters and salmon runs to benefit a Canadian mining company is unacceptable.

To continue to argue for further hearings and review is arcane and a huge waste of taxpayer money.  The EPA has done its job carefully already.  Do not risk this watershed and fishery to toxic waste for a copper mine.

	My name is Bailey Bergstrom and I am a senior at Humboldt State University. I am writing this comment on the EPA's proposal to withdraw the 2014 determination that the Pebble Mine should not be allowed as disposal sites for the Pebble Mine in Bristol Bay. Proposal to Withdraw Proposed Determination to Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Are, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 (July 19, 2017).   I am concerned for the Bristol Bay fishery because my favorite animal is salmon. Because of this, I understand how important these fish are culturally, economically, and ecologically. When I was fortunate enough to visit South East Alaska, the thing that stood out to me most was the vast amount of plants and wildlife. When we were able to visit the Anan bear conservatory where we saw an incredibly healthy salmon run with bears, eagles, and other smaller animals. The incredible amount of life that congregated around the stream to consume the salmon was astonishing. The bears would catch the fish and the eagles and other critters would eat the carrion spreading the nutrients from the carcass all the way into forest and sometimes even into the trees. After seeing this beautiful feast, I could not imagine all of these animals convening around a dirty and polluted stream. Bristol Bay has a lot to lose if the EPA decides to withdraw the 2014 Clean Water Act Proposal Determination. 
	I do believe that the EPAs original proposed determination was correct and they should continue to protect the 50 million salmon that return to Bristol Bay every year. By continuing to restrict the use of dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit, the EPA can avoid a total disaster. The Bristol Bay Fishery provides 12,000 jobs locally, and millions of jobs in total. Bristol Bays travel industry is also dedicated to fishing and hunting. If the salmon don't return both of these industries could take a dangerous economic plunge. The Pebble Limited Partnership (owners of Pebble Mine) also have not yet filed a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit application. This is concerning because Section 404 of the CWA establishes a program to regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States. This permit is exactly what The Pebble Limited Partnership should have had to apply for and complete. The only industries that are exempt from Section 404 regulation are things like certain farming and forestry activities which of course this mine does not fall under either of these categories. If The Pebble Limited Partnership were to get a Section 404 permit, they would be subject to a permit review process. This is important because if the effects of the Pebble Mine, which will be the largest open pit mine in Northern America, are significant than they can lose their permit and would have to clean up the waterway to be able to reapply.  I believe that if the EPA withdraws its proposed determination it won't be meeting the mandate it was given based on the Clean Water Act. In the Act it states that ""[The Clean Water Act was to] provide for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife...and to eliminate all discharge of pollutants into the nation's waterways by 1985."" Although we have obviously not met this goa,l the EPA could make change in our environment for better or for worse. I believe the EPA should follow the Clean Water Act and continue to make Bristol Bay a refuge for five species of salmon and a thriving fishery. Now is the time to be on the right side of history.

While mining is necessary to support our current lifestyles, large scale mining operations should not be located in the sensitive and unique ecosystems of Bristol Bay. There are two compelling reasons for this:

First, EPA should move forward using the scientific information that it has gathered to support this PD.

The EPA conducted a thorough, multiyear scientific investigation of the Bristol Bay Watershed and potential impacts from the proposal(s) by Northern Dynasty to mine the Pebble Deposit. Based on the projected impacts of a mine far smaller than those proposed to the company's investors, EPA concluded that mining operations would cause unacceptable adverse effects on fish and animal habitats in the Bristol Bay Watershed.  Consider the 29 species of fish, 40 terrestrial mammals and 190 species of birds that would be impacted; the losses of streams and wetlands; and the contamination of the land and water.  The magnitude of the projected environmental impacts are well documented in EPA's peer reviewed report, and these losses will be irreversible. The largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world will be destroyed forever, and the livelihood of those that depend on the salmon will also be destroyed. 

Second, EPA should move forward on this PD because it already followed an extensive public process on this matter, and it is a complete waste of government resources to ignore the existing scientific work and its conclusions and to begin a new project review process.

 EPA provided opportunities for public comment on two draft scientific assessments, which generated hundreds of thousands of comments. The current proposed to withdraw the PD is essentially waste, fraud and abuse of the Agency's procedures and its resources.  The EPA followed the Clean Water Act and its procedures.  In fact, EPA went above and beyond   the required procedures and offered two draft reports for public comment prior to publishing its final assessment. Administrator Pruitt, as reported in several newspapers, concluded that the PD should be withdrawn after meeting with advocates for the Pebble Mine. The Administrator has provided no information or evidence as to why the existing scientific assessment is flawed; in fact, to the contrary, the Administration states that the mining companies should have an opportunity to submit proposals and conduct environmental impact statements and as such, a fair process for moving forward. The process to date - with EPA's publication of the Final Bristol Bay Assessment in January 2014 -- was a fair process and compliant with the Clean Water Act. The existing EPA assessment is a thorough and legitimate basis for moving forward with the Clean Water Act 404(c) protections. 

Thank you for consideration of these comments.

I fail to see what has changed with the land since the original assessment conducted by the EPA in 2012. The 2014 Determination proposed by the EPA to limit mining within the Bristol Bay area on the basis that the mine would cause ""irreversible and unacceptable damage to the Bristol Bay salmon ecosystem."" The EPA Office of Inspector General investigation stated that ""The EPA addressed guidelines and followed policies and procedures when conducting the Bristol Bay watershed assessment. We found no evidence of bias or a predetermined outcome."" There is no reason for the EPA to withdraw from the proposed determination if the assessment of the Bristol Bay area was accurate and conducted without bias. Which it was. The creation of this mine would harm some of the nation's best waterways for commercial and recreation fishing. Bristol Bay supports the largest Sockeye- Salmon run in the world, with around 46 percent of the world's population being produced in this region. The mine would impact waterways that support 29 of species of fish, 190 bird species, and more than 40 species of mammals, some of which depend on the salmon spawning. Damages to the Bristol Bay waterways would also have a negative impact on 31 Alaskan Native Villages that depend on the Salmon both for food and survival and the $480 million of economic activity that the fish produce. The salmon runs also contribute to more than 14,000 full and part time jobs to this region. The idea of destroying one source of income for the area to implement a new one that destroys the fragile ecosystem is ludicrous to me. The Native Alaskans have been using Bristol Bay as a fishing source for thousands of years and losing this fishery would change their way of life dramatically. If the fishery were destroyed, food for the local communities, commercial fishing exports, and tourism from recreational fishing in this world class spot would also be destroyed. The Pebble mine has no guarantees of economic increase to the area, only the guarantee of destroying a unique and valuable ecosystem.

	My name is Stephanie Bowler and I am an Environmental Science and Management student at Humboldt State University in Northern California. I am writing this comment on behalf of the EPAs proposal to withdraw the 2014 Proposed Determination of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10 Pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act. The EPAs 2014 decision on the Pebble Mine states in the Effective Summary (page ES-3) that The Bristol Bay Assessment established that the extraction, storage, treatment, and transportation activities associated with building, operating, and maintaining one of the largest mines ever built would pose significant risks to the unparalleled ecosystem that produces one of the greatest wild salmon fisheries left in the world. I deeply agree with this ruling because the deposit of wastewater from the mining of copper, gold, and molybdenum-bearing minerals will destroy the pristine ecosystem of Bristol Bay to such a degree that the ecological impacts will be irreversible. My position on this matter is to keep the 2014 decision on the Pebble Mine.
	The 2017 decision to withdraw the 2014 determination clearly goes against The Clean Water Act (CWA). The CWA is an essential law that helps the EPA reach their objective to protect and restore the environment and public health for current and future generations. Section 404(c) of the CWA authorizes EPA to prohibit, restrict, or deny the use of any defined area in waters of the United States for specification as a disposal site whenever it determines, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, that the discharge of dredged or fill material into the area will have an unacceptable adverse effect on fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas). The Pebble Mine deposits will cause direct toxicity which will result in reduced survival and reproduction of fish, specifically the sockeye salmon and the Chinook salmon populations. On page ES-1of the 2014 Proposed Determination, it is mindful of the economic significance of the salmon ecosystem. The commercial wild salmon fishery in the Bristol Bay region has an estimated value of $300 million in sales from fishers to processors (EPA 2014: Chapter 5). The original policy decision of 2014 is a valid and extremely valuable rule because it will protect the ecosystem of the precious salmon resources for future generations. The proposed site of Pebble Mine is adjacent to two major watersheds that spread throughout the South-West of Alaska. The intrinsically complex network of wetlands, river, and streams in the Nushagak and Kvichak watersheds are very sensitive to changes and will result in widespread destruction because they are all connected to each other. The wastewater contaminates will spread throughout the watersheds and will exponentially damage the neighboring streams and wetlands. 
	In conclusion, the decision to withdraw from the 2014 ruling on Pebble Mine will have terrible impacts to the environment, the coveted salmon populations, and the communities that rely on them. The negative effects of the Pebble Mine will outlive the short term profit gain from the materials extracted in Bristol Bay. The EPA should resist submitting to the mining industry by striving to protect the watersheds and the people of Alaska. I urge the agency to deeply consider the environmental impacts of this project that were outlined in the 2014 ruling and ask oneself if these impacts are truly not valid in 2017. Many aspects of the environment are at stake with the implementation of this project. The consequences of this decision are a direct threat to over 14,000 fisheries jobs in the community. For many generations, the locals of Bristol Bay have relied on salmon to continue the traditions of their ancestors and to protect their way of life. The cultural and economic value of this ecosystem and its organisms are too great to be ignored by short term profits.

I, Stephanie Bowler, do not support the decision to withdraw from the 2014 determination. Thank you for your time.

Hello,

I am a student at Humboldt State University pursuing a major in an Environmental Planning and Policy degree. I believe that the EPA's decision to propose to withdraw the proposed determination to restrict the use of an area as a disposal site; Pebble deposit area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 (July 19, 2017) violates the regulations outlined in paragraphs (a) and (c) of 40 CFR 231.5 of the Clean Water Act (CWA), Section 404 (c). Decisions such as these will result in harm to the people of Alaska and the wilderness and waterways that they depend upon for subsistence resources.

40 CFR 231.5 paragraph (a) outlines the time frame allowed to the regional administrator to either recommend determination or withdrawal after an initial proposed determination. Being that the public comments and hearings occurred in August and September of 2014 and the notice of withdraw of proposed determination occurred in July of 2017, due to an injunction proposed by Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP), this two year time period greatly exceeds the acceptable amount of time allowed for region 10's administrator to either recommend determination or withdrawal. As PLP is the holding company to the subsidiaries who own the mineral rights in question, it is clear that the lawsuit producing the injunction was intended to prohibit the EPA's final recommendation from being made.

40 CFR 231.5 paragraph (c) states that when a proposed determination is made, the regional administrator himself, or a designee, must decide on whether or not a withdrawal of a proposed determination should be made and the appropriate actions to take following this decision. Because the EPA's decision to withdraw the proposed determination was made under a settlement agreement created by the EPA and PLP, the decision was not the EPA's alone. Furthermore, accepting the negotiated settlement terms created by PLP, which excepts the project from review by Section 404(c) for a certain amount of time, temporarily forfeits the responsibility of enforcing CWA mandate. The agency does not possess the right to decide to ignore mandates, nor can these terms be agreed upon between an outside party, other than those specific situations outlined by Congress. 

Overall, the EPA's decision to propose to withdraw the proposed determination to restrict the use of an area as a disposal site; Pebble deposit area, Southwest Alaska, is arbitrary and capricious because it runs against the agencies initial decision of determination for no scientifically backed reasons. Withdrawing the proposed determination negates the EPA's responsibilities to uphold the CWA, thus endangering the Bristol Bay watershed fisheries, the Alaska Native people and their cultures, and the wildlife present in the region. Regardless of complaints put forth, the EPA does have authority to initiate a Section 404(c) review and the Bristol Bay Assessment (BBA), which was extensively peer reviewed and follows EPA guidelines for ecological risk assessment, does hold scientific credibility as well as the ability to influence the Section 404(c) process. For these reasons, the EPA should not go forward with its decision to withdraw the proposed determination of the site in question.

The state of Alaska voted it down overwhelmingly. The EPA studied it for years and came to the conclusion it is too risky. Many many Americans have written in and voiced opposition. 
I don't believe for one  instant that NorthenDynansty is thinking of a ""small"" mine. They will be required to maximize profits for its shareholders. Once in there it is my belief that they will mine all they can and others will follow. The infrastructure to just get there will determine that more mining will happen. 
The waste from these open pit mines would have to be contained FOREVER without failures. The likely hood of a leak is too high. 
I am not opposed to all mining. But Bristol Bay watersheds is not the place for it!!! 
You can not buy back a clean healthy watershed full of the greatest salmon runs in the world once contaminated.
Please  reflect on that and tell Pebble mine and  any other wanting to ruin the amazing Bristol Bay watersheds NO NO NO!!!

I am a concerned citizen writing to comment on the EPAs proposal to withdraw its previous proposed determination that Pebble Mine should not use certain waters in the Bristol Bay watershed as disposal sites. Proposal to Withdraw Proposed Determination to Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 (July 19, 2017). In 2014, the EPA properly exercised its authority under the Clean Water Act, Section 404(c), when it issued the proposed determination that should not be withdrawn due to the severe environmental, economic, and cultural consequences.
Page 33,123 of the Federal Register states that the proposed withdrawal of the proposed determination is part of the settlement agreement of the lawsuit that Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP) filed against the EPA. PLP claimed that the proposed determination was a violation of federal law. However, section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act authorizes the EPA to restrict, prohibit, deny, or withdraw the use of an area as a disposal site for dredged or fill material if the discharge will have unacceptable adverse effects on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or recreational areas. In January, 2014, The EPA completed an assessment of the potential impacts of large-scale mining of the area on fisheries, wildlife, and native cultures of the region. Subsequently, the EPA correctly exercised its authority to propose a determination that would restrict the discharge of pebble mine and protect the area from degradation. This process does not prevent a potential applicant from submitting a permit application to the Army Corps. Therefore, PLP could have done so while the 404(c) action was in process.
Bristol Bay contains an incredibly productive fishery where salmon play a very important role in the functioning of its ecosystem and the local communities. And according to the EPAs draft assessment of Pebble Mine, the fishery provides 35.5 million sockeye salmon annually, at least 14,000 jobs, habitat for an abundance of wildlife species, and subsistence to Alaska Natives. However, disposal of the dredged or fill material into these waters could have detrimental effects on the salmon as well as other aquatic organisms. Other impacts include a reduction in amount and quality of fish habitat, and loss of thousands of acres of wetlands. Wetlands are also of great ecological importance as they help to maintain water quality, serve as erosion and flood control, and provide habitat and recreation. I would certainly call these unacceptable adverse effects.
Proponents of the mine claim that it will provide jobs and benefit the local economy, but in doing so it would also take away many jobs that currently exist such as those of fishermen. The benefits are simply not worth the risk. Whats more, the sheer size of the mine is too much of a risk, for if it fails the effects could be disastrous and irreparable. Therefore, I am urging the EPA to protect the livelihood of the local community and fulfill its duty to protect the environment by exercising its authority to under the CWA to prohibit the discharge of dredged or fill material from Pebble Mine into the Bristol Bay Watershed.

you not to withdraw the proposed determination to adopt restrictions
protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon.

The proposed determination was made at the request of local
communities and adopted only after years of rigorous scientific study,
public participation and peer review. The EPA was correct in 2014 when
it found that the Pebble Mine would have ""significant and unacceptable
adverse effects"" on ""one of the most productive, pristine, valuable
and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America today.""

The EPA has noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates
hundreds of millions of dollars annually in direct sales of
commercially caught salmon, generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon
support not only the commercial and sportfishing industries, but a
traditional Native way of life that has endured for millennia and
thrives today.

The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and take all
necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed.

Part of my young adult life was spent out along the Selway and Lochsa Rivers.  Rivers abundant with fish and recreational opportunities.  I have never personally been out to the proposed site of the Pebble Mine, but I am sure that the environment that encompasses the area is just as pristine and beautiful as my native area of personal growth.  These places were about spiritual maturation and respect for one's self and the environment.  John Muir wrote about the beauty of these wild places, holding them up as temples and places of worship.  I am writing to point out my disagreement on the EPA decision to withdraw its 2104 decision on the Pebble Mine Proposal to Withdraw Proposed Determination to Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 (July 19, 2017).
In the Code of Federal Regulations under title 40, section 404C, the ""Purpose and Scope"" section clearly states that the regulations will restrict and deny anyone from causing any ""unacceptable adverse effects"" to a healthy ecosystem.  This also restricts the use of rivers and creeks in a watershed, and any large scale dredging operations. The scope and size of the Pebble Mine mining operations would drastically alter the watershed causing a collapse of the Bristol Bay Watershed.  Under the ""Extension of time"" section the administrator of EPA Region 10 may extend the deadline for the regulation. The drastic turn of events from the Obama administration and today's administration clearly states this.  Section 404C clearly states its intentions to protect water resources in and around a proposed project site by rejecting permits.
	When it comes down to it litigation, money, and a supply and demand economy will determine the outcome of an important decision.  Much of the problem lies in the public policy, a policy that can be misguided by the President of the United States.  The decisions and outcomes form these actions can polarize the public citizen, and put into jeopardy the natural environment.  The actions of the executive branch can be an overreach of power.  I think certain decisions can be irresponsible without careful consideration of all stakeholders. It's important that we follow the rule of law and to place our decisions on sound science and public participation on any level.  We must follow the process alone without the pressures of need and desire.  There needs to be more of an analysis and full public knowledge of the project.  I agree with this law with some reservations.
	Clean air and water should be a right and not a discretionary issue.  Where do we decide to change course?  When will we say ""enough extraction and consuming?""  It's not an easy decision to make, due to our appetite for ""more is better"" attitude.  Our indifference towards understanding the world we live is evident throughout time.  But I am hopeful that we will gain an appreciation towards one's self identity.

I am writing to comment on the EPA's proposal to withdraw its 2014 determination that the Pebble Mine should not be allowed to use certain tributaries as disposal sites for the Pebble Mine. Proposal To Withdraw Proposed Determination To Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 July 19, 2017. EPA's decision in 2014 carefully looked at the impact of mine waste disposal in tributaries. However, now it appears the agency is more concerned with mining interests rather than the watershed ecosystems and people of Alaska. One reason I am interested in this proposal is because of a watershed class that I am taking this semester. We have discussed the negative effects that large sediment deposits can have on fish populations. This will clearly be an issue if the EPA withdraws its 2014 decision. 
This proposal can threaten many, if not all, of the organisms in the watershed such as salmon and other fisheries. Rivers and streams typically have a certain load of sediment they can suppress. If more sediment is added in from the mine, the quality of the water will be reduced, which will impact the fish. If this material is discharged into tributaries the fish would not be able to see and they would be ingesting large amounts of sediments from the water. Additionally, the Bristol Bay is one of the last places on earth that has the largest salmon runs. Many fear that the disposal of mining material in the Bay will negatively impact the fish as well as animals that depend on them. Moreover, fish are not the only ones negatively impacted. In fact, many people who live close to the proposed Pebble Mine will be affected too. Fishermen (and fisherwomen) rely on these fish for a steady income and fishing in the Bristol Bay has been sustainable for many years; though Pebble Mine could bring in a number of jobs, the fact that those jobs will only last up to fifty years should not be forgotten. Another issue relevant to state is that accidents can happen. Even if the mine were to become operational and if they are not allowed to dispose of anything in the tributaries, accidents are bound to happen. Deposits from the mine could infiltrate into the soil and down into the ground water. In turn, this could then travel to streams and rivers, which could affect fish and other species. 
I do not believe EPA's proposal to withdraw its 2014 determination is good policy. I think EPA's first proposal in 2014 had a better understanding of the harm that can come from this proposed mine. The purpose of the Clean Water Act (CWA) is to govern water pollution. One section of the CWA that is worth mentioning is section 404; this particular program establishes ways to regulate the amount of dredged or fill material in bodies of water. One part of section 404 is especially interesting, which states that there will be no discharge of materials if there are alternatives that are less damaging to the ecosystem. Fishing is that alternative and it is one people in that area have used for many years. There are more than 14,000 jobs nationwide that rely on the bay and the fishing industry generates more than 1.5 billion each year. Sure the mine will bring in jobs and money too, but the fishing industry will fail because of it. In addition, to me it seems as though the EPA should have the authority to restrict the disposal of mining material in the watershed because this would be a point source. Also, in order to attempt to do this, Pebble Mine will have to get a permit from the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), which is managed by the EPA. It appears Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP) does not have this permit from the readings that I have done. This is a good thing because PLP cannot legally dump anything into the waters until the permit is received. 
The proposed Pebble Mine in the Bristol watershed area will have a negative effect on fish species and human populations in the area. EPA's new proposal appears to be looking at mining interests rather than the communities that are around Bristol Bay. The mine will bring in jobs and money into the economy; however, the fishing industry is already so large in Bristol Bay and they accumulate a large amount of money each year that section 404 of the Clean Water Act should apply to this. Furthermore, if the mine were to become operational, nearly all the fishers in Bristol Bay would lose their jobs due to the impact that the dredged and fill material would have on the fish. Overall, I think the EPA needs to review its decision again and look at the impacts that this mine will have on communities in the bay.

As a naturalist with an aspiration to protect and restore wild lands, I am disheartened by the EPA's proposal to withdraw its prior 2014 Proposed 404c Determination. Large scale mining will not only result in adverse effects to wildlife and habitat, it will also have detrimental effects to the indigenous communities of Bristol Bay. I am writing to comment on my position against the Proposal To Withdraw Proposed Determination To Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 (July 19, 2017.) 

This proposal seeks to reverse the efforts made by the Obama EPA to assess the impacts of mining the pebble deposit in the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds. An extensive assessment, The Effects of Large Scale Mining on the Salmon Ecosystems of the Nushagak and Kvichak Rivers found that large scale mining would cause significant harm to the fishery. This finding violates the Clean Water Act and under Section 404(c): the EPA is authorized to prohibit or restrict fill activities if the Agency determines the project would have unacceptable or adverse effects on fishery areas. ""The assessment indicates that the proposed Pebble Mine would likely cause irreversible destruction of streams that support salmon and other important fish species, as well as extensive areas of wetlands, ponds and lakes"" (EPA 2017). These effects include loss of streams, loss of wetlands, lands and ponds and stream flow alterations. 

Bristol Bay is home to the largest sockeye fishery in the world, the salmon runs have been supporting native subsistence fishing communities for over a millennium. In return these communities have assumed the position of stewarding the Bristol Bay watershed. As a collective, the United Tribes of Bristol Bay are strongly against the mining operations and have continually rallied and petitioned to express their opposition. These salmon runs not only sustain the income of Native residents, but are also the basis for Alaska Native culture, social relations, and spirituality (EPA 2017). The EPA has claimed to consider the Native's deep connection to the land and dependence on it however, its actions are proving otherwise. Rather, if the EPA carries out the withdrawal of the 2014 proposed determination it is certain to jeopardize decades of relationship and trust building with Tribes of the US. 

On page 33123 and continuing onto 33124 the proposal states, ""If Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP) submits a permit application to the Army Corps within 30 months from the date of settlement...the EPA may not move forward with a signed Recommended Determination for 48 months from the effective date of the settlement agreement..."" Section 404 of the Clean Water Act directs the EPA to develop the environmental criteria the Army Corps uses to make permit decisions (EPA 2017). It does not seem productive or appropriate to have a setback date for the EPA to take action. This is a process that fully encompasses the purpose and responsibility of the Agency, and should not be taken away for PLP to gain time towards swaying Trump EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. 

If the PLP is granted the opportunity to mine one of the worlds most productive marine ecosystems, the EPA will have changed the course and meaning of everything environmental protection represents.

The main reason why I believe 82 FR 33123 should not be reconsidering the fate of Bristol Bay, Alaska is for the sockeye salmon. Here in California we are consistently struggling with saving our salmon population and it is very concerning. Globally, our main principle should be to protect those habitats which are still thriving greatly as diverse systems. With many other pollutants on this planet, I can say that we do not need to add to this amount any longer. We should be protecting our waters at all costs, not going back on previous decisions to get rid of this protection for these ecosystems.
The Bristol Bay watershed in Alaska  is extremely important for the United States in many ways: there are jobs, food and other benefits from these waters. But more importantly it's crucial to the lifestyle of its numerous inhabitants. The headwaters are the beginning of the whole river system, disturbance at the start can be highly detrimental to the functionality of every player trying to contribute to the well-being of the ecosystem. Due to mining, the river could become extremely polluted and demolish all standards that were previously set. These standards were created to put the watershed under protection. There is clearly a purpose for why the originally proposed determination (79 FR 42314) stated that the river should not be subjected to such pollution from mining practices. The Clean Water Act was established for reasons to protect United States from polluted waters due to types of dredged or filled material from mining. The clean water is beneficial for the inhabitants but also the survival of other wildlife. There are many endangered salmon and this location is a huge sanctuary for these fish. We should not risk getting rid of one of the last great salmon habitats. I don't believe that the permit can even justify the true impact that creating this mine could have on the environment. In order to maintain quality water, no changes should be made to the previous decision.  
To be completely honest , I'm sure we can find more alternatives to mining such as recycling products of similar resources. We are in a day and age where there should be more renewable and sustainable practices.I feel there hasn't been many alternatives considered in this case. The developers of Pebble Mine want to say that there will be no effect on the wildlife but where is the proof? I really doubt they can prove there will be no significant impact on the salmon and the surrounding habitat due to mining practices.  If the mining begins, the destruction will actually affect many organisms along the Koktuli River and Talarik Creek. Increase of sulfur from the soil creates acid harmful to not only the fish, but the other organisms, creatures and mammals that rely on this water system. The gold and copper can be highly beneficial to the economy but also causes more concern about the future of the environment.  It is a debate between environmental or economic stability. Economic stability is what we lean for but there are other approaches and the Bristol Bay still supports its own healthy economy. Without the clean water there is no diversity. Without this diversity, it is harder for communities of organisms to collaborate in a healthy manner. And often, we forget how these ecosystems can affect our lives in the long run. The Pebble Mine developers should absolutely not be able to discharge into these thriving streams.

Northern Dynasty is 100% owner of the Pebble Partnership, which is advancing the world-class Pebble deposit in Alaska towards permitting and development [1]. This group wants to develop mines in a relatively pristine wilderness area. This is a one of a kind fishery and is relevant throughout the entire fishing community. Numerous freshwater nursery lakes and shallow estuaries make up Bristol Bay and it is the largest commercial sockeye salmon producing region in the world [2]. This is a very significant species of fish which migrates upstream to spawn and the populations of these fish are relevant to the health of the entire ecosystem. The proposed withdrawal of preventative measures from allowing the dumping of pollutants as discharge from mining into the surrounding rivers. What is helping to prevent this area from exploitation is the Clean Water Act and the amendments which were made in section 404(c),  as this authorizes the EPA to prohibit, restrict, or deny the discharge of dredged or fill material at defined sites in waters of the United States [3]. There seems to be a conflict with the water quality and the proposed mining operations. I would like to oppose the proposal 82 FR 33123 (July 19, 2017) to withdraw to proposed determination to restrict the use of the Bristol Bay area as a disposal site. This site should be protected, not exploited. The mining will only support jobs for roughly the next 50 years. If taken care of, this seasonal run of salmon could support jobs for the locals and food for Americans and the world for centuries to come as long as proper regulation and management practices can be implemented and followed. The mining operations in Bristol Bay are backed by Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. Their mission statement is to develop the Pebble Project: a strategic resource of copper, gold, molybdenum and silver, representing the future of US mining and metals [2].  This value statement is very specific in what they determine to be about. Their objectives are about material objects with monetary value. The supply of minerals in the area will only be sustained for a limited number of years with the proposed mining operations.The salmon are a more important renewable energy resource than the copper mined for new electronics. There are populations of an important species which will equate to more money and potential profits in a number of years. Over time the monetary value of the salmon will supersede the value of the proposed mineral extractions and not to mention the implicit costs of restoring the rivers and surrounding watershed afterwards when it has been massively polluted with discharged sediments and particulates. The minerals have been there since the cretaceous period and will not be going anywhere by themselves. To jeopardize the watershed which has supported this particular ecosystem for centuries is not worth the environmental degradation, even if it is literally for gold.If there is even a possibility for continued mining near the area, it must be done without contributing to stream pollution and sedimentation of native spawning gravels. This will be nearly impossible to do and to remove the regulations which are supposed to protect the wildlife could have severely negative repercussions. These fish are anadromous, traveling from the ocean upstream to spawn and their success depends on a combination of many different factors as it is Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd is a company which values to design, permit, build and operate a modern mine at Pebble that fully co-exists with healthy fish and wildlife populations and traditional ways of life in southwest Alaska, and enhances the economic and social well-being of all Alaskans [2]. This companies listed values does not correlate very well with them destroying the river systems. Proportionately these head waters support most of the world's sockeye salmon and would be largely affected by the dumping of discharge and sediments into the streams and rivers. This would not be good considering the fish are for human consumption as well. If there were ways to go about mining with a very large buffer between any major river pathways than maybe it could work, but there are no shown proposals that have proven safe mining practices can occur here. They claim responsible mining, but do not directly layout their methods of how they will be extracting the precious metals from the earth. This proposal for removal seems to be nothing but a large lump sum land grab. The vote should go to support the continued enforcement of the regulations in place which protect the environment and we should vote against the effort to repeal the 2014 amendments to the Clean Water Act.

That determination, put in place by the Obama administration, was done so because they recognized the grave environmental risks associated with opening up these areas for mining. Opening up Bristol Bay to Northern Dynasty Minerals is a blatant giveaway to the mining industry at the expense of Alaskan residents, Native American communities, and Americans as a whole. It's appalling.

The Bristol Bay watershed generates over $1 billion dollars annually, and supports over 14,000 jobs. This makes it the most valuable wild salmon fishery in the world. It's also an incredibly popular tourist spot for individuals and families, and it's part of the culture and traditions of multiple Alaska Natives. All of this will be wiped out if the Pebble Mine project is allowed to move forward. This mining project would produce 10 billion tons of waste, turning this pristine area into a toxic wasteland for decades to come. There's no way to gauge how long it would take to clean something like that up, or if restoring it would even be an option. 

Additionally, withdrawing from the Proposed Determination and allowing mining is a deeply unpopular proposition. More than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen oppose the mine.

The EPA needs to do its job - protect the environment - and not allow the Pebble Mine to move forward. It's toxic and has no place in Bristol Bay.     ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Consistent with previously stated positions, UFA is opposed to withdrawal of the EPA's July 2014 404(c) Proposed Determination for the Pebble Mine in the Bristol Bay watershed.  UFA expressed support for proactive 404(c) action in an October 2010 letter to the EPA Administrator and reiterated support for the Proposed Determination in a September 2014 letter.  UFA's position against any presently conceivable development of the Pebble Mine remains unchanged. Previously submitted letters are attached for reference.

The risks of large-scale mining in the Bristol Bay watershed have been well-documented prior to and throughout the investigative process that led to EPA's Proposed Determination. UFA's position opposing development of the Pebble deposit with respect to conceivable mining options is largely based on a well-documented and practical reality that extraction of desired minerals from the area's low-grade, acid-generating ore requires massive amounts of excavation and containment that is certain to damage salmon spawning and rearing habitat.  In addition, there is an unacceptable risk of a catastrophic event or multiple events at the mining site that could severely compromise downstream environments, particularly for salmon. EPA investigations and analyses that led to the 2014 Proposed Determination served to clearly corroborate those concerns. 

UFA's support of the proactive use of the 404(c) is also based on a desire to have a more stable seafood business climate that is free from the risks of potential disruption from mining development.  Part of the market value for Bristol Bay salmon is based on the perception of puritylarge-scale mining in the watershed would compromise those attributes and any mine failures such as a tailings dam breach would be especially difficult to overcome in the market. Record salmon runs and favorable market conditions of the last few years underscore the importance of a healthy salmon fishery to the Bristol Bay region, the State of Alaska and the entire country.  In 2017, the Nushagak River saw the largest run of sockeye salmon in recorded historyit is one of the major drainages downstream of the Pebble Mine site.  Although the Nushagak River is not typically known for its sockeye production, it is by far the biggest king salmon system in the Bristol Bay Region.  In contrast to commercial fishery prospects, financial backing for the Pebble project has largely evaporated as its economic viability and environmental risk has been more fully understood by private and public interests through EPA's investigations and analyses related to the Proposed Determination.   

The following points are listed as reasons considered by UFA over the years in supporting the Proposed 404(c) Determination and opposing EPA's proposed withdrawal: 
The Bristol Bay salmon fishery is a significant and integral part of the Alaska's statewide commercial fishing industry with economic benefits that accrue far beyond the state's borders. 
The 2017 run of 56.5 Million fish ranks second highest of the last twenty years. 
2017 preliminary ex-vessel value at $214 Million
First wholesale value of $417 Million in 2014
Accounts for 25% or more of the value of Alaska's overall salmon harvest.
Provided 8,395 harvester jobs and an additional 3,485 processing worker jobs in 2014. 
Low-grade, acid-generating ore would require massive excavations and storage of tailings in perpetuity.
Site development and transportation corridor requirements that would cross multiple salmon spawning and rearing streams and affect adjoining aquatic habitats. 
Inadequacy of technologic mitigation of mine development and operation impacts on salmon. (Note failures of Columbia River hatchery and other mitigation projects as an example) 
Complex hydrology of region makes prediction of mining impacts and risks on groundwater and streamflow difficult.
High seismic risk at mine site and in the region. 
Salmon markets that are sensitive to environmental perceptions and seafood industry desire to have business stability.
Indemnity and legal protection for losses to fishermen not well established and historically difficult to uphold. (Note US Supreme Court overturning of jury verdict on Exxon Valdez oil spill)
Questionable economic viability of the Pebble Mine as indicated by 2013 divestment by Anglo-American and February 2017 Kerrisdale Capital report and recommendation to short-sell.

UFA urges the EPA to refrain from withdrawal of the 2014 Proposed Determination based on the factors outlined above.

Sincerely,
							
Jerry McCune						Mark Vinsel
President						Executive Administrator

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. This mine will need to store it's waste forever. Any leak from the waste from mining copper and gold will destroy the last true salmon spawning ground. Salmon is practically extinct on the East coast. 
These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. It is not even a US company!!! All this risk for a foreign corporation to send US metals back to their homeland.

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.

This comment will address the proposal by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw its July 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination that would, if finalized, have imposed restrictions on the discharge of dredged or fill material associated with the potential ""Pebble Mine"" in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed.

Synopsis: It is not in the economic, commercial or political interest of the United States, the state of Alaska or the Environmental Protection Agency to permit Northern Dynasty to continue with the Pebble mining project. It clearly endangers future economic and social conditions in Bristol Bay with the most powerful of indicators betting against it. Free market capitalism says this project is a bust and if the EPA waives 404(c) protections for this project it will still fail and will only damage the community it is impacting with no long term benefits.

the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds in southwest Alaska.
I am against constructing a mining operation, whether it be Pebble or any other company, in the Bristol Bay watershed
or in any watershed that is important to fisheries, especially those of Pacific salmon. It is irresponsible and shortsighted to 
alter and damage an ecosystem that supports a SELF- SUSTAINING and RENEWABLE economy (salmon fishery) 
and replace it with an economic base that will produce toxins while withdrawing a LIMITED resource. 
It is ignorant to ignore the three year study conducted by the EPA that identified the importance of the Bristol Bay ecosystem
and its fishery. And it is ignorant to ignore history. Regardless of the study, mines are boom and bust. It will end. 
Any town created, any economic bolstering and any profit that goes into the hands of a few will end. Relics of this industrial 
fact are strewn across the country as abandoned mining towns. Ghost towns. That is the inevitable future of this project;
A toxic skeleton of a human operation dedicated only to maximizing profit, surrounded by the decaying mass
of its irreversibly damaged ecosystem.
However, if the protection on this watershed is upheld and is partnered with the continued responsible 
management of the Sockeye salmon fishery, then there exists a mine that will continue to produce. 
As a concerned citizen, I plead that the protections of the Bristol Bay watershed are kept in place. Let there be an
American legacy of protecting this pristine ecosystem.

My name is Payton Hammer and I am a senior at Humboldt State University. I am studying environmental economics and have a minor in Natural Resources and Management Planning. I am commenting on the EPA's decision to withdraw the 2014 proposed determination of the Pebble Mine near the head waters of the Bristol Bay watershed. Proposal to Withdraw Proposed Determination to Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 44,176 (July 19, 2017). I think that the proposed pebble mine deserves to be able to take all the steps necessary to see if they can go through with this proposed mine, however, I do not support the mine at all and would need substantial evidence from an EIS. The risks are far greater than the benefits and if the EPA approves this project I will be deeply disappointed in the EPA under our current administration.
First, I would like to address that I think Northern Dynasty Minerals does not have the right to go through the Environmental Impact assessment process. The EPA has already struck down the Pebble Mine project under section 404 (c) of the Clean Water Act which restricts any discharges of dredged materials into wetlands or watersheds. The environmental impacts of a mine as large as this is going to have an immense impact on the environment around it. I would also like to comment on the fact that in Alaska there has been strong resistance against the mine from the very beginning. Most Alaskans think the mine is a bad idea and will have adverse economic and environmental effect.
The proposed Pebble Mine is a gross misjudgment that if goes through with the development will result in an environmental, economic and spiritual tragedy. Bristol Bay is a billion dollar fishery that provides over 14,000 full and part time jobs. Bristol bay and the Kvichak and Nushagak Rivers are home to all five of the pacific salmon species and is the only places in the world with a fully functioning salmon based ecosystem. The Kvichak and Nushagak watersheds are home to Native Americans who, like their ancestors whom have lived there for over 4,000 years, live a sustainable way of life based on the annual salmon runs. 
The people of Bristol Bay are dependent on the annual salmon runs either for subsistence or a wage and if the pebble mine is allowed to go through it will have serious consequences on the people. We cannot allow the idea of short term monetary gain win out against one of the sustainable ecosystems in the world.

RE: Call for comments on proposal to withdraw proposed determination to restrict the use of an area as a disposal site; Pebble Deposit area, Southwest Alaska 

To whom it may concern:

Thank you for the opportunity to convey the Alaska Chamber's support of withdrawing the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) determination on the Pebble Deposit Area.  

The Alaska Chamber is a non-profit founded in 1953 working to promote a positive business environment in Alaska.  The Chamber is the voice of small and large business representing hundreds of employers and local chambers across Alaska.  Our member companies employ over 100,000 hard-working Alaskans.  We support resource development that is both done in a responsible manner and brings economic opportunity to Alaska and its residents.

In an unprecedented move the EPA adopted a proposed determination regarding the Pebble Deposit Area that ignored existing processes, undermining agency responsibilities on both the state and federal level.  The Alaska Chamber believes that any project should have the opportunity to go through the existing legal processes.  In the case of a mining project like Pebble there are more than 60 major permits from local, state, and federal agencies.  If the process determines a project as designed cannot protect the environment and other resources, it will not advance. Until an application is filed describing in detail and an Environmental Impact Statement is completed, the EPA is making determinations based on hypotheticals and assumptive modeling.

If the Pebble Project makes it through the existing legal process proving they can operate the mine in a responsible manner, the economic benefits are enormous not just to the local economy in the immediate area but to the State.  Mining provides for good paying jobs, some of the best-paid in the state, at almost $100,000/year.  Pebble anticipates employing up to 1,000 full-time workers throughout the first 25 years of production, and as a whole mining companies operating in Alaska have a workforce that is 75% Alaska resident. Beyond that they also pay up to $165 million in taxes, rents, royalties, and fees to state and local governments, and $172 million to Alaska Native Corporations.  

The Alaska Chamber encourages the EPA to withdraw its determination on the Pebble Deposit Area and let the project succeed or fail on the merits of the project as designed and not by speculating on what might happen.


Best regards,



Curtis W. Thayer

EPA studies have documented that the mine would have a hugely negative impact on the clean waters and on the fish that live and spawn there. And this is assuming there are no spills, leaks, or illegal dumping, which of course happens too often.
 
It's getting to the point that there is little food that we can be sure is still safe to eat. Fish may contain mercury and/or plastic micro-beads. Crops may contain high levels of pesticides. Farm animals may contain antibiotics or growth hormones.

Please do not allow any company - a non-American company, no less - to jeopardize one of our best sources for healthy food.

Contaminated waters are contributing to high rates of cancers and various serious illnesses. Contaminated foods are also taking heavy tolls on Americans' health. This puts burdens on our already expensive health care system (best case scenario) and reduces our work force (worst case scenario).

As another aspect to consider, suppose this mine were to go forward. Who is going to monitor regulation compliance?  Who is going to enforce regulations?  Who is going to clean up any accidental contamination?  Given that the current administration would like to decimate the EPA, who is going to look out for our food & health safety? Because the mining company certainly won't.

The EPA has already determined that the planned pebble mine would cause great damage to the unparalleled salmon runs and local fisheries as well as to local Native communities.  

The FOREIGN-OWNED pebble mine would cause significant damage to the world-renowned salmon runs of Bristol Bay. This fishery is worth moth than 1.5 million dollars a year and supports 14,000 jobs. All of this would be put at risk for the interests of a FOREIGN mining company.

I object in the strongest way possible to the reversal the EPA may make with respect to the Pebble Mine project at Bristol Bay. In 2014, after a four-year review process, the EPA said Bristol Bay Watershed was too fragile to support large scale mining.
Because of the proximity to the watershed this will threaten the salmon industry (1.5 billion - plus 14,000 jobs in Bristol
 Bay area). Please do not allow short-term interests to destroy the environment for future generations.


Can we not save what we have now for the future?  Please do not let special interest destroy a crown jewel of our American heritage.

The July 2014 proposed determination should not be lifted or reconsidered.  History has proven time after time that pristine natural environments have intrinsic as well as monetary value.  Jobs and precious metals are valuable but to place any kind of mine in Bristol Bay would be short sighted in the worst way.  My home in the Pacific Northwest has experienced salmon habitat destruction and the resultant salmon population decline.  It has affected our region negatively both economically and spiritually.  The decline of salmon populations have cost fishing jobs, fish processing jobs not to mention all the tourism losses as sport fishing has declined.  To build a mine and to subject Bristol Bay to the effluent and waste that is unavoidable when mining would be unethical at best.  Years of peer reviewed scientific research clearly demonstrate the fragility of the Bristol Bay ecosystem as it pertains to salmon.  There is then no need to lift the proposed determination as any mining operation would threaten the fragile balance and the salmon.  Therefore, I emphatically implore the EPA to keep the July 2014 proposed determination that will keep Bristol Bay safe and prevent any analysis of mine building or other deleterious use of that pristine fishery.  

Respectfully,

Dr. Michael Van Dyke D.O.

The fishery supports thousands of jobs and provides federal and state tax dollars, and does so on a sustainable basis, meaning that the revenue will continue to flow into coffers and provide economic benefits to the area in perpetuity.  The same cannot be said for a mining operation, which, at best, would provide jobs for a period of time and then close after resource extraction was no longer economically viable.  Approving mining in this area would therefore be extremely short-sighted, and would be likely to have a long term negative impact on the local economy (by potentially harming the sustainable fishery) without having a similar long-term benefit.

Please do not withdraw the restrictions imposed on this area.

Across the world, salmon populations have been wiped out or greatly diminished, to the point that ""Atlantic Salmon"" is only available through farming, even as global appetite for salmon has increased significantly.  Bristol Bay is already a great economic boon to the local economy as it currently is - a sustainably managed fishery that employs thousands of people.  And that is money that stays with the local community, not siphoned away to a foreign parent company.  If President Trump and his administration is as committed to supporting American workers, they should be looking at this in the long term.  The mine would employ 1000 while it's being developed - a few year at most - and another 1000 during its short life, with the profits going to a Canadian company.  Eventually, the mine's resources will be depleted and it will employ no-one other than EPA and hazardous waste crews.  Because that is all that will be left - a wasteland of toxic materials.  Compare this to a sustainably managed fishery that will last FOREVER - a God-given gift - and create no such terrible externalities.

The Mining company will insist that its footprint is small and that it will take proper precautions, but ecosystems are so delicately balanced that even slight disturbances can cause ripple effects.  And even proper precautions would not be enough.  Remember the the torrent of toxic waste that was released when the EPA itself was in the process of securing an old mine?  Please remember that.  Please remember that this country has so much more to offer than dead metals from the ground and that we are smart enough and courageous enough and bold enough to create economic opportunities that don't destroy our natural heritage.

And if money is the only thing that matters, remember that it costs FAR less to protect existing habitats and ecosystems than to seek to restore them after we humans have made our mark.  And a mark we will make indeed if we let this mine go forward - from oil spills, to natural disasters in areas where homes have replace natural barriers, to a floating pile of garbage in the ocean larger than the size of Texas, when have we humans ever gotten things perfectly right?

The sound reasoning and science is already before the EPA in the wonderful research that was done. The EPA is already aware that a dam or other barrier will not be able to contain the toxic wastes of mineral mining entering and polluting the waterways. The short term gains are not worth the irreversible desecration and damage to the land.

Please, for all things of meaning do not let corporate wants outweigh the will of the American People.

I am writing against the withdrawal of the EPA's 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination that would have placed restrictions on the discharge of dredged or fill material from the potential mining of the Pebble deposit in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed.

The decision by the prior Office of the EPA to move forward with the 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination was based on sound science and a desire to protect the highly sensitive, highly productive waters of Bristol Bay, Alaska. Due to the integrity of the science in hand, an EIS is an unnecessary and costly exercise. Tax payer dollars should not be allocated to any further consideration of a loosening of restrictions on mining activities in Bristol Bay, Alaska. 

I do not support one company's - Pebble Limited Partnership - over the business of hundreds of fishing boats, or the health of the Bay and all the animals, fauna and flora that rely on the health of the Bristol Bay ecosystem for their own health and survival. The multi-decade process of constructing the mine would have damaging and irreversible impacts on Bristol Bay. The activities of the mine in operation would lead to its ultimate destruction as a source of one of the largest wild salmon fisheries in the world. It would mean economic and cultural devastation to the many communities who rely on the fishery for survival. 

Please proceed forward with the EPA's 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination, as they are designed to balance all interests in this vital environmental and economic resource.

The potential impacts of the proposed Pebble Mine on the health of the Bristol Bay watershed and the livelihood of thousands of people in Alaska are far too great. Those risks include loss of up to up to 94 miles of salmon-supporting streams and up to 4,900 acres of wetlands and ponds, and the very real potential of wastewater dam failure resulting in damage to or destruction of the salmon fishery. The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world and 25 federally recognized tribes who for 4,000 years have depended on the fishery for their subsistence-based culture. The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the project, and a statewide majority of voters also oppose it. The watersheds unique ecological resources generate significant economic benefits and employment. EPAs original watershed assessment was scientifically robust and thoroughly peer-reviewed. That assessment and related public comments should strongly influence any future action.

I deeply care about protecting the environment globally and the statutes that were created to honor that. I am commenting against the withdrawal of the EPA's 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination: The Proposal To Withdraw Proposed Determination To Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 (July 19, 2017). I would like to argue against this withdrawal for many reasons.
Bristol Bay, Alaska is one of the most valued salmon fisheries on earth. It includes all coastal and inland waters east of a line from Cape Newenham to Cape Menshikof, including 9 major river systems. Several freshwater nursery lakes and shallow estuaries make Bristol Bay the largest commercial sockeye salmon producing region in the world. Bristol Bay has long been recognized as a vital contributor to Alaska's commercial fishing economy. The bay has been such an important contributor that in 1972 the Alaska legislature determined that it was in the best interest of the state to establish the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve. The reserve was designed to protect Bristol Bay fisheries' longstanding and valuable commercial, subsistence, and sport fishing from oil and gas development. We need to maintain this protection, not only for the fish but also all other living things that are within that ecosystem in Alaska.
Why now? After decades of protection and work that has been put into the Bristol Bay Fisheries Reserve and the Clean Water Act, now is the time to let mining interests in to destroy the habitat? The area is regarded as one of the world's most important salmon fisheries, producing nearly half of the world's annual sockeye salmon catch. Its ecological resources also support 4,000-year-old indigenous cultures, as well as about 14,000 jobs, according to the EPA's 2014 report.
 The original determination would have placed restrictions on the discharge of dredged or fill material from the potential mining of the Pebble deposit in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. Years of work have been put into preventing harm to Bristol Bay. Now, the EPA agreed to initiate a proposed withdrawal process pursuant to policy direction from EPA's Administrator, as part of a settlement agreement in May 2017 with the Pebble Limited Partnership. Pebble Limited Partnership's subsidiaries own the mineral claims to the Pebble deposit. 
After years of work and planning that have been put into the Bristol Bay watershed to maintain the wildlife and clean water, the EPA is now entertaining mining companies interests. Scott Pruitt, the new head of the EPA made this decision moments after meeting with a mining company. According to CNN, after three years of peer-reviewed study in 2014, the Obama administration's EPA invoked a rarely used provision of the Clean Water Act to try to protect Bristol Bay after finding that a mine ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of the bay. The withdrawal of the determination would clearly mean the United States as a whole would be worse off. Because Bristol Bay supplies so much of our salmon, creating a mine and allowing the runoff would take away the international importance of the beautiful land and state of Alaska. Do not let corporate interests ruin this country. Do not let large scale mining companies ruin such a precious and fragile part of this country.

I am writing to you today regarding the EPA's newest proposal to waive the restriction of the Pebble Mines disposal of mine tailings and other waste. In other words, the ""Proposal to Withdraw Proposed Determination to Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 (July 19, 2017)"". The withdraw of the 2014 proposal may lead to the detriment of the surrounding environment and might cause long term water pollution in Bristol Bay. I fully agree with the EPA's original decision to restrict Pebble mine waste disposal without a proper permit as stated in the Clean Water Act, section 404 (c).  Allowing this mine to dispose in the area violates the Clean Water Act; the potential pollution is too great and seems too costly to repair. I am also requesting response for what possible measures can be taken to prevent this issue. 

This proposal should not be instated and review for a permit to dispose of mine tailings or any kind should be a requirement due to the possible negative impact that pollution could cause on the Bristol Bay waters. If the waste were to escape into the surrounding water environment, the pH levels will drastically fluctuate and in turn, as stated in the 2014 proposal, ""[deprive] fish habitats of nutrients, groundwater inputs, and other subsidies"". Salmon can only survive in a narrow window of pH water levels. A study done by J. J. Magnuson, J. P. Baker, E. J. Rahel and J. R. Kramer in the published journal called ""A Critical Assessment of Effects of Acidification on Fisheries in North America [and Discussion] (1984)"", shows that the salmon fish can populate with stability in waters with the pH window of 4.5-6.9. Possible contamination from the mine tailings could change the water pH well out of this range.  I have come to the awareness that one of the main resources that the Pebble mine is attracted to in the area is the copper. Copper water contamination can negatively affect the fish habitats. I have done some research on the effects of copper mine tailings and found that the particle size of these tailings, when mixed with water and oxygen gas, can create a wide array of pH concentrations. The variability of particle size affects the amount of acid or base that is needed for neutralization.  How will those who are responsible for taking care of contamination be able to neutralize a leak? I believe it will be especially difficult to maintain the proper pH for the fish habitat granted that there be a spill. Another study done by Robertson and Bryan incorporated in a writing called ""PH Requirements of Freshwater Aquatic Life"" explains that there is a ""deterioration ""that occurs to the aquatic life when habitat pH water levels change out of range. I fear that the overall Bristol Bay pH water levels will be too costly to try to control/ neutralize if part of the area was used as a disposal site.

The plan to withdraw EPA's ""Determination to Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 (July 19, 2017)"" is an idea that might seriously alter the chemical composition of the waters in Bristol Bay. I agree with the 2014 proposal in that the Pebble mine deposits could leave ""unacceptable adverse effects on fishing areas."" I think that the plans of pebble miners should go through the permitting process stated in the Clean Water Act Section 404 (c) before being allowed to dispose.

Proposal To Withdraw Proposed Determination To Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 (July 19, 2017).  The agency's 2014 determination correctly addressed the harm to the ecosystem of the Bristol Bay watershed that would be caused by the mine. Upholding the 2014 proposal is the right thing to do to ensure that the Pebble Mine does not infringe on the rights of the local citizens to live in a healthy environment. 
On page 33124, the Federal Register states that the EPA, ""believes that withdrawing the Proposed Determination ... is appropriate at this time for this particular matter,"" in order to  ""remove any uncertainty ... about PLP's ability to submit a permit application and have that permit application reviewed"". The Register is sure to note on the same page however that the initiation of the 404(c) process ""does not preclude PLP from submitting an application and the Army Corps from reviewing that application,"" the only halt is that ""the Army Corps could not have issued a permit while a section 404(c) process was ongoing."" The 2014 proposal should be upheld in order to keep the mine accountable. 
The Bristol Bay watershed is a very diverse and important ecosystem; the largest natural salmon run is intact in these waters. Fish are very finicky, especially salmon, so the smallest change in the surrounding environment can devastate salmon populations. The amount and quality of salmon impact fishermen and recreationalists, neither of which enjoy fewer and sicker fish.  As fish are rather sensitive to environmental changes, they would fall victim to water pollution from the mine before the human communities would notice symptoms of lowered water quality. While the mining lease may be under a century, the effects are everlasting. 
Submitting the 2014 proposal is the best way to ensure that Pebble Mine is able to operate sustainably and not ruin the livelihoods of other industries using the same area. The value of minerals fluctuate greatly, whereas water always has inherent value. The withdrawal of the 2014 proposal would show priority the government takes for businesses over it's citizens. Corporations have no right to deteriorate the health of the public simply because it would make it easier for them to make more money that would be better dispersed throughout the wealth distribution anyway. There has to be a point where the health and well-being of the American public are a priority over a few number of elites making more millions. The past has proven that there are consequences to disregarding the environment and ignoring public health. The mine will impact the area for at least decades after its last dredge. The health of the people and ecosystem of the Bristol Bay watershed should have higher priority over a business that sees the possibility of an opportunity to extract wealth for a short period of time. The 2014 proposal is a good use of the EPA's discretion in order to keep the Bristol Bay healthy.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

As a long time observer of the Pebble project, periodically as a stockholder in NAK, it has been appalling to see the impediments set in place by government regulatory bodies toward the development of a mine. After-all, the site is within the Alaska State Mining District. This fact alone should have removed many of the obstacles that the project has faced.

Only due to the tenacity of Hunter Dickinson, the parent company of Northern Dynasty, has this massive project progressed to the current status.

I know of no NAK stockholder who wants to bring harm to the salmon life cycle in the vacinity or to the local inhabitants. All any of us have ever asked is to allow NAK to present its case to proper decision makers. 

Many mining experts, some from the university setting, have stated that the mine can be developed in parallel with the salmon industry. 

It would seem that the only prudent course of action at this point would be to allow the permitting process to run its course and listen to the US Army Corp of Engineers in their evaluation. From this outcome, a plan take of action can be taken with regard to the future of the proposed mine.

Proposal To Withdraw Proposed Determination To Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 (July 19, 2017). Under the Clean Water Act, the decision (based on the peer-reviewed scientific and technical findings) to restrict Pebble Mine from utilizing certain water bodies in the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds as disposal sites in 2014 was appropriately analyzed and should not be withdrawn. If the determination is to be withdrawn, it only proves that the new EPA administration is prioritizing the profit of a foreign mining company, completely neglecting the economic, environmental, social, and cultural value of Bristol Bay to the residents of Alaska.
On 79 Fed. Reg. page 42315 (July 21, 2014) of the Proposed Determination, EPA Region 10 decided to restrict Pebble Mine from using the said specific water bodies due to the ""high ecological and economic value of the Bristol Bay watershed"". Bristol Bay, generating almost $500 million in economic expenses and sales, provide employment for more than 14,000 workers. If the EPA persists on the withdrawal of the accurate determination, the Pebble Mine would take away Bristol Bay's residents and Alaskan communities' source of income for indefinite generations only to create roughly 1,000 temporary mining jobs. The mine would strip from the people of Alaska the healthy ecosystem they have depended on to remain sustainable for many years. 
Again, on page 42315, EPA Region 10 specified under the Clean Water Act, peer-reviewed scientific and technical findings determined ""unacceptable environmental effects that would result from such mining"".  ""In total, the three mine components: mine pit, tailings impoundments, and waste rock piles, would cover an area larger than Manhattan."" ""Given the extent of streams, wetlands, lakes, and ponds both overlying the Pebble deposit and within adjacent watersheds, excavation of a massive mine pit and construction of large tailings impoundments and waste rock piles would result in discharge of dredged or fill material into these waters"". According to the Clean Water Act Section 404(c), ""no discharge of dredged or fill material may be permitted if the nation's waters would be significantly degraded"". If the Proposed Determination is withdrawn, the Pebble Mine will pollute these bodies of water stated and there will be a complete loss of fish habitat and the wetlands, streams, and other aquatic resources will no longer be able to contribute to the economy and sustainability of Alaskan people. The Pebble Mine will leave irreversible effects on the environment. Bristol Bay, being the last place on Earth with ""bountiful and sustainable harvest of wild salmon"" will never be as diverse and striking as it is ever again. If the EPA allows Pebble Mine to have this tremendous negative effect on the environment, one can say that the agency no longer adheres to what it should wholly stand for. 
Furthermore, on page 42315, ""One of the main factors leading to the success of this fishery is the fact that its aquatic habitats are untouched and pristine"". ""These salmon populations, in turn, maintain the productivity of the entire ecosystem, including numerous other fish and wildlife species"". The respect and significance given to salmon and other wildlife, along with traditional knowledge of the environment, have formed a continual sustenance-based way of life that is a key element of Alaska Native identity. This is preserved due to the undisturbed state of the Bristol Bay watershed. EPA's withdrawal of the Proposed Determination, would lead to the impairment of such a rich culture.
Bristol Bay is one of the last places on Earth that has a prosperous wildlife able to sustain its people. Prioritizing foreign mining interests at the expense of the American people and the economy would be absurd. It would be arbitrary to withdraw a decision accurately made from the beginning. The 2014 Proposed Determination to restrict Pebble Mine from utilizing Bristol Bay as an area for disposal should be maintained. It is the EPA's job to conserve the area for the people and the future of Alaska.

Proposal To Withdraw Proposed Determination To Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 (July 19, 2017). It is clear that the original 2014 determination was created with a purpose, which was to protect the tributaries of the Bristol Bay from the previously determined potential environmental harm that would result from the Pebble Mine using said tributaries as disposal sites. The EPA is going back on the original decision that is directly supported by section 404c of the Clean Water Act, and that tells me that their perspective has been corrupted. Whether it's because money or the power of the Pebble Limited Partnership, the EPA is changing its mind on a determination that is only in place to protect the tributaries of a river ecosystem and to ensure the safety of Alaska's citizens. 
	On page 33123, the notice states that if the Pebble Limited Partnership files a permit application during the months from the date of settlement, the EPA may not move forward with a signed Recommended Determination for 48 months. This catches my attention because I am not willing to endanger the environment in and around the Bristol Bay for another four years while the PLP may or may not attempt to apply for a permit. The EPA needs to act on broken laws and enforce the Clean Water Act to its fullest extent. 
	On page 33123 it also states that the EPA's Administrator is choosing to withdraw the 2014 determination in order to provide PLP with additional time to submit a permit application to the Army Corps. Since when is it alright for a governmental agency choose to look past their purpose, which in this case is environmental protection, and give those who are polluting our waters a break from the law? The EPA's initial determination was put in place for a reason, and we should be doing everything in our power to ensure that our waters and ecosystems are safe before assessing the impact on a mining company. Because of these reasons, I do not deem it fit for the PLP to be given more time to submit a permit application that should have been submitted previous to the initial determination. In fact, the application could have been submitted while the determination was placed on the PLP, but it was not. 
	The initial 2014 determination to enforce section 404c of the Clean Water Act and restrict the disposal sites in Bristol Bay for the Pebble Mine was undeniably the correct decision by the EPA. It is solely in the EPA's power to restrict and/or deny the discharge of a material into defined sites of water in the United States. It is made blatantly clear on epa.gov that the decision to enforce section 404c will be made after concluding that the dumping sites will have ""unacceptable adverse impact on one or more of the various resources"" in the ecosystem. Since none of the practices from the Pebble Mine have changed between the 2014 determination and present-day, those items that the EPA had previously labeled to have ""unacceptable adverse impacts"" on the environment are still in existence. With that knowledge, the EPA is changing its standards and expectations by withdrawing the 2014 determination to form to the interest of the mining company instead of the interest of the environment. 
	In conclusion, the EPA's proposal to withdraw its 2014 determination and allow the Pebble Mine to use tributaries in Bristol Bay as disposal sites for even more time than they already have is unacceptable. It is the EPA's job to enforce the laws and regulations within their power in order to protect the environment and the people of this country, not to protect the interests of the Pebble Mine. The EPA's Administrator should review and reconsider the withdrawal decision in order to fulfill the standards of the EPA.

Proposal To Withdraw Proposed Determination To Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,123 (July 19, 2017).   
I am a senior environmental science major and have studied not only environmental laws and policies but the ecology of watersheds throughout my time at university. I therefore cannot support the proposal to withdraw the EPA Region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination; I do not believe that PLP should be allowed to dispose of dredged or fill material into the Bristol Bay watershed due to the environmental harm this would cause and I believe that the EPA should use their authority under the Clean Water Act to stop this. 
Under the Clean Water Act this withdrawal clearly should not be allowed. The Clean Water Act does not allow for point-source pollution into navigable waterways and waterways that are important to and connected to navigable waterways. The South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds are all a part of the larger, navigable Bristol Bay watershed, which supports a large commercial and sport fishing industry that nearby communities rely on. 
Bristol Bay and the surrounding tributaries has the largest sockeye salmon population in the world as well as large populations of other anadromous fish, all of which are sensitive and keystone species, and all of which the local communities, especially indigenous, rely on for subsistence. Disposing of mining waste and other sediments into these waterways would severely impact these species and the communities that depend on them. Impacting these fisheries would ruin the economy of this area and deprive most of the locals of their jobs and source of income.  
I understand the argument that the mine would create new jobs and new income for the area, and while that sounds like a great thing, it'd be at the sacrifice of the jobs and income from the fisheries industry. The fishing industry around Bristol Bay isn't a small one either; this area provides half the world's sockeye salmon harvest! The area is known as America's ""fish basket"". Anadromous fish are not the only species that use these waterways; seals, walrus, whales live here as well, and these species all have ecological and cultural significance as well. 
On page 33123, the notice states that ""the Agency agreed to not exercise its discretion regarding Section 404(c) review for a certain period of time."" The EPA should in no way give up the authority to deny PLP's permit under Section 404(c), because PLP's mining operation would cause ""unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas,"" and this is unacceptable under the Clean Water Act. 
If the EPA does withdraw the Proposed Determination, the EPA will be putting industry above the health of people and the environment. The EPA originally concluded that the Pebble Mine would cause unacceptable adverse environmental impacts, and the EPA should stand by their original decision and use their authority to prevent the pollution of these waterways and the destruction of economically and ecologically important natural resources. If the waters of Bristol Bay are sacrificed for industry, this sets a precedent that could be frightening in its implications and would result in a loss of faith in the EPA and its intentions.

Proposal to Withdraw Proposed Determination to Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 33,124 (July 19, 2017).  The 2014 determination was issued by the EPA in order to protect the areas pristine environment that sustains one of the largest salmon fishery's in the world.   After years of collecting scientific data, the EPA had indicated the potential threats an open mine, like Pebble Mine, would have on its ecosystem.  Thereby, they authorized under the Clean Water Act Section 404(c) to ""prohibit, restrict, or deny the use of any defined area in waters of the United States for specification as a disposal site whenever it determines, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, that the discharge of dredged or fill material into the area will have an unacceptable adverse effect on fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas)"".  The determination of 2014 was decided because of the scientific evidence that reveled the adverse effects PLP, or any mining company, would have on the Bristol Bay watershed.  
To begin, on page 33124, the notice states that the Administer is proposing to give additional time to Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP) so that they may have sufficient time to submit their application to the Army Corps.  This is in hopes that PLP may be able to continue on with the rest of their permitting process without having the EPA finish, and possibly having to enforce, the initial determination proposed in 2014 under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act.  Though, the permitting process by the Army Corps would typically decide whether to approve or deny the permit, the EPA determined, after sufficient evidence was collected, to administer their power given in section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act.  This indefinitely would have prevented the PLP permit from being passed.  The EPA in 2014 made this decision based off of the scientific data that illustrated the detrimental effects a mine would have on the economy, environment, and social capital in the local region  The EPA's only objective is to protect the people of Alaska, the people of the United States, and their natural resources.   
The EPA also states on page 33124 that the ""withdrawal of the Proposed Determination would remove any uncertainty, real or perceived, about PLP's ability to submit a permit application and have that permit application reviewed"".  I begin by questioning why this this section is even in the withdrawal? I say this because it was not the withdrawal of the Proposed Determination that kept PLP from submitting a permit; it was PLP itself that decided not to after the 2014 Proposed Determination.  The Clean Water Act, specifically section 404, is a respectable policy that the EPA can use to determine the criteria used by the Army Corps to issue permits.  As history displays, majority of the time the EPA, Army Corps, and industries can, and will, negotiate terms in order to allow industries to move forward in the permitting process while still following certain environmental criteria to ensure the protection of the watersheds of the United States of America.  With that being said, under Section 404(c), it allows the EPA to ""prohibit or restrict fill activities if EPA determines a project would have unacceptable adverse effects on fishery areas."" There are only thirty instances, according to the EPA website, of section 404(c) being enforced by the EPA.  Of those 30 times, there have been only 13 final determinations issued.  This demonstrates how limited these issues are used and it also demonstrates why Section 404(c) was written in the Clean Water Act in the first place.  Each determination, including the one on Bristol Bay, was issued on behalf of projects that would've had degraded a piece of environment that is vital for the United States of America.

I am very disappointed that you plan to reverse course and green light the proposed Pebble Mine, despite the catastrophic risks it poses to Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed, its world-renowned salmon runs and its Native communities. 

Under the Obama administration, the EPA, after years of rigorous study, proposed science-based restrictions that would have banned the dangerous Pebble Mine to protect Bristol Bay from the myriad of environmental risks this massive gold and copper mine would pose. Your recent settlement with Northern Dynasty Minerals to reverse those common-sense restrictions is a blatant giveaway to the mining industry at the expense of the American people, our environment and our economy.

Bristol Bay's wild salmon fishery supports 14,000 jobs and is valued at more than $1.5 billion annually. It also supplies nearly half of the world's sockeye salmon. More than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen oppose the mine.

I urge you to listen to those voices, and for the sake of the Bristol Bay watershed, its world-class salmon fishery and its people, keep the door closed on Pebble Mine.

I have visited many copper mines in Utah and Arizona and find that all have had a negative impact on the environment. Many of these mines ran out of money and remain a blight to the land. The common problem for large open pit mines is that they mean well in the beginning but the price of metals fall and they sell their ownership of some foreign  interest that is solely focused on scalping the cream and not following the original restoration safeguards. A common practice with large mines. Current politicians do not have the will to take on the mining community for several obvious reasons.

As an Alaskan, and a citizen of the world, I am asking you to keep in place the Clean Water Act restrictions on mining the Pebble ore deposit in the Bristol Bay Watershed. Do not allow these pristine waters to serve as a disposal site for dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit.
Bristol Bay, and its surrounding watershed in southwest Alaska, is home to the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery, and one of the largest and most prolific king salmon fisheries.  Bristol Bay produces half of the world's salmon.  This ecosystem is tremendously productive, and depends on an abundant supply of clean, fresh water. Thirty Alaska Native tribes in this region depend on salmon for their subsistence, culture and livelihoods.  The salmon fishery is estimated to support 14,000 full and part time jobs at a value of $1.5 billion annually.  In addition, recreation and tourism in the area is responsible for another $90 million of State revenue due to licenses and taxes.  All of this is threatened by the proposed Pebble Mine.
The Pebble ore body is acidic, requiring treatment in perpetuity. It is totally unrealistic to assume that mining an acid-producing ore body this large, and in the heart of a pristine watershed, could be managed to prevent acid drainage from leaching into adjacent streams, wetlands and estuaries.  There is no example on the planet that would give you hope that this is possible.  To say this could be an impact on the $1.5 billion Bristol Bay salmon fishery is an understatement.
And, if one needed any further reason for concern, look what is happening to fisheries around the world. Two insightful articles were published this summer which illuminate why Bristol Bay needs protection. The farmed salmon industry is threatened by sea lice which are proliferating in stocks worldwide 
http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/health/ct-sea-lice-salmon-industry-20170918-story.html and salmon caught in Seattle's Puget Sound were found to have a variety of drugs and personal care items from Prozac to caffeine, from ibuprofen to bug spray. 
https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/drugs-flooding-into-puget-sound-and-its-salmon/
So the 1.5 billion dollar question is....why would we want to put one of the last wild fish stocks at risk? Keep the Clean Water Act restrictions in place and give the world an abundant supply of healthy salmon. 
Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.  Pebble has an atrocious track record.

The EPA was right to stop this in 2014 and nothing has changed. Mining of this type has no place in most of the world, certainly not in Bristol Bay.

Alaska is an incredibly vulnerable environment and any perturbations to the ecosystem such as heavy metal mining waste contamination to water bodies can have unpredictable and lasting consequences. The state of Alaska is currently in a budget crisis and relies heavily upon its fishing industry, which Bristol Bay is located in the heart of. Any threat to the livelihood of the salmon population can have the capacity to further cripple our economic state. Additionally, many Alaskans rely on subsistence harvesting, therefore a contamination event as a result of less stringent restrictions on mining waste also threatens human health in addition to environmental and economic health. It is also unpredictable how long any deleterious effects would remain in the environment, fish, and humans following contamination. I do not see the purpose or benefit of lifting the Clean Water Act restrictions and doing so only increases the risk of a catastrophic contamination event occurring.

These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

There are many arguments against this move, including:
1) Local communities are against this, including 80% of Bristol Bay locals and 85% of their commercial fisherman. Remember, this is their environment that will be destroyed.
2) It would adversely affect the salmon fisheries in Bristol Bay, which would be economically devastating to the area and to my belly. I don't know about you, but I love wild salmon. 
3) You might dismiss the EPA under previous administrations, but their science is solid. Allowing a mine in Bristol Bay and allowing it to pollute the waters there would be deleterious to the environment and economy.
4) An accidental discharge from the mine into the waters or surrounding environment would have devastating consequences.
5) Studies show that mines regularly violate water protections and pollution regulations. Mining operations continually pollute our waterways. They do not have a good track record, and I don't see how this will be any different.
6) The economic advantages of such an operation are questionable. The fishery already supports 14,000 jobs.
7) Thoughtlessly exploiting areas like Bristol Bay for questionable economic purposes goes against the entire purpose of the EPA.

Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

In 2014 the Environmental Protection Agency proposed common-sense science-based restrictions that would have banned this dangerous mine because of the obvious environmental risks it would pose. The EPA's recent settlement with Northern Dynasty Minerals to reverse those common-sense restrictions is a blatant giveaway to the mining industry at the expense of the American people, our environment, and our economy.

In addition to the engineering, legal, and economic problems (as in, completely non-viable) the mine faces, there is the obvious issue that no one can predict earthquakes and no one know with certainty the position of the Lake Clark fault near the proposed Pebble Mine site. Northern Dynasty's current plans indicate that the four earthen tailing dams would be engineered to withstand 7.8 magnitude quakes at a distance of 18 miles when two USGS studies suggest the fault may actually lie within 5 to 10 miles of the mine site, effectively tripling the effects of a similar magnitude quake.  Extremely powerful earthquakes, quite common in Southern Alaska, could corrupt the massive earthen containment dams either through dam failure during shaking or landslides that cause dam failure -- dams holding 10 billion tons of highly toxic mining waste, a miniscule percentage of which, if released, would be devastating to the health and survival of aquatic life in the Upper and Lower Talarik creeks, the Koktuli, Stoyahok, Chulitna and Newhalen rivers, as well as Iliamna Lake and the Kvichak River that drains the lake into Bristol Bay.  

Salmon are acutely, fatally, sensitive to copper and other heavy metals and even the smallest release of these compounds could have catastrophic effects, not only on the Sockeye, Chinook, Coho, Chum, and Pink salmon, but on several species of trout, and their prey species as well.  It could harm 28 additional fish species, 190 types of birds, and numerous species of land animals that rely on these crucial waters. 

Even ignoring the toxicity, the huge freshwater withdrawals and the perpetual (centuries long) water treatment and waste management poses significant long term environment risks (and financial risks to the public if the cost of treating acid rock drainage and heavy metal leaching has been underestimated, as it almost always is with similar large sulfide mines in wet climates).

Such large scale mining projects are abhorrent anywhere, but in places such as Bristol Bay - places of such pristine beauty and flourishing abundance of wildlife - they are completely unacceptable and beyond contemplation for any reasonable person.  Even the damage caused by preliminary testing and infrastructure development is significant, let alone the full scale development of the open-pit monstrosity and toxic wasteland that would be the Pebble Mine legacy for centuries.

As you well know, these headwaters and bays are home to the most productive salmon fishery on earth.  The Bristol Bay watershed is an ecosystem of international significance as it is the world's largest remaining wild sockeye salmon run which produces roughly half of the world's commercial sockeye salmon. These abundant salmon cycles have sustained native peoples and legions of wildlife species in the surrounding wetlands and tundra for many thousands of years, and today the salmon fishery is a healthy $1.5 billion industry seasonally employing more than 14,000 people. The Bristol Bay watershed sustains the culture and traditions of Alaska Natives, including the Yup'ik and Denai'na, two of the last intact, sustainable, salmon-based cultures in the world.

Even assuming the mine operator intended to be extremely cautious in regards to the environment, it wouldn't matter!  The very construction, operation, and decades-long toxic mine-waste generation and centuries-long waste containment issues would ensure the permanent destruction and utter ruination of the premier salmon habitat and fishery on earth.

The public has overwhelmingly rejected the Pebble Mine project. More than 65 percent of all Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents, and 85 percent of commercial fisherman strongly oppose the Pebble Mine.  Indigenous peoples, commercial fishing operations, hunting and fishing groups, retailers, outfitters, conservation organizations, 58 major jewelers, and MILLIONS of concerned individuals in the United States and around the world are opposed to this project and will not cease in their efforts to stop the Pebble Mine from being developed.

Teck, Mitsubishi, Rio Tinto, and Anglo American saw the writing on the wall and bailed on this environmentally catastrophic and money-losing project.

Copper adds convenience to my everyday life.  More importantly my standard of living is massively improved in terms of health, productivity and comfort as a result of an affordable and reliable source of copper and the products it makes available to us.

Fish are important, clean water is important, ecosystems are important - but we will lose the countless benefits we get from cheap domestic copper and other hard rock materials if we always make concessions in the interest of other resources.

Copper mining has allowed us to advance our technology to the unprecedented scale it is today. We can use this technology to evermore efficiently and safely mine new resources.  This is not a pipe dream.  We can all clearly see evidence of this truth just by comparing the way we live now to the way we lived 50, or 100 years ago. 

Their is opportunity for both the responsible treatment of the environment and that of sustaining the maintenance of our current infrastructure as well as the less impacting, more efficient, clean and exciting one to be from the ever advancing state of our technological capabilities.

Preservation can be pervasive in our mindset as we extract the materials we need to sustain the thriving living standards and equality among diverse communities that is available to modern societies.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Please consider my comments to support the withdrawal of the Proposed Determination of the Pebble Deposit Area, as follows:

The proposed determination ignored existing processes, undermining agency responsibilities on both the state and federal
level. Further, the EPA does not have the authority under the Clean Water Act to preemptively block development in the 
absence of a permit application.  The EPA must withdraw its proposed determination because it was based on an untested, 
ad hoc analysis that is not sanctioned by the CWA or NEPA. Once the NEPA process is initiated, the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement based on project plans.  A preemptive decision, prior to permit 
or project application and completion of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, is unacceptable, whether it
be approval or denial of any project in any industry.

Every project, no matter the size or location, should have an opportunity to be reviewed under existing legal processes. In
the case of mining, there are more than 60 major permits and hundreds more from local, state, and federal agencies that 
must be successfully obtained. If the process determines a project as designed cannot protect the environment and other 
resources, it will not advance. The process will not permit one industry or resource to advance at the expense of another.

Any 404(c) action outside the existing permitting process would be an extreme case of federal overreach and an assault on
Alaska sovereignty. The Pebble deposit is not located on federal land, nor inside a refuge or park. It is located on state land 
designated for mineral exploration. The State of Alaska depends on the responsible development of natural resources on its
lands to diversify and support its economy.

Until an application is filed describing the project in detail and an Environmental Impact Statement is completed, the EPA is 
prematurely determining adverse impacts based on hypothetical assessments and inapplicable modeling.

The fate of a project, including Pebble, cannot be rationally decided without consideration of the full social, economic and 
environmental impacts of the project. This information will be developed through the rigorous NEPA process.

EPA Representatives,

       I write in reference to docket EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369-0001.

       I am strongly opposed to any decision that will allow any firm or individual to mine the area covered in this docket in any fashion.

       I strongly urge you to consider the impact - both immediate and long term - of such a mining operation.

       If you have doubts or truly want to seriously consider the proposed relaxation of water and water shed protections for this area, then you should visit existing and closed mines of this type in the continental US and Canada.  See for yourselves the impact they have in the area.  See the destruction, the ugliness, the waste water, the tailings, and the debris piles.

      Read the requirements for visiting such an area.  Read the warnings for anyone in the area.  Read the impact of getting the toxic material on your clothes, in your eyes, or in your respiratory system.

      The imagine the impact of living in such an area full-time as the local tribal families and US citizens do.

      I urge you again to vote against any such changes or approvals that would allow this company or any entity to mine this area.

      
Sincerely,

Bill McClendon

The proposed Pebble mine project would sit at the headwaters of Bristol Bay's watershed, which is home to annual wild salmon runs that exceed 50 million fish. Bristol Bay's $1.5 billion annual sustainable commercial fishery provides 14,000 jobs and supplies half of the world's sockeye salmon. The Obama EPA conducted an extensive study that left little uncertainty to the potential hazards of the project. In its proposed determination, the EPA said peer-reviewed scientific and technical research determined that the effects of the mining would have ""unacceptable environmental effects."" This study was an extensive three-year, twice-peer reviewed scientific assessment that found a mine like that proposed for the Pebble would have ""significant"" and potentially ""catastrophic"" impacts on the Bristol Bay watershed. According to polls, though, more than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen oppose the mining project. I am outraged that the current EPA feels obliged to put commercial interests and profits before the obvious negative impacts that this mine will have for the area, its resources, and its economy.

This is the worst place for a project like this. The volume of toxic waste produced from the smallest mine proposed at the Pebble Mine project in the Bristol Bay watershed of Alaska would be enough to fill a professional football stadium more than 880 times. The toxic waste produced by the largest of the proposed mines at the site would do so more than 3,900 times. Disposal of the waste material from the mining would require the construction of up to three mine-waste impoundments, covering an additional 19 square miles and including waste-rock piles covering up to 8.7 squares. All of these deposits will be occurring in an area that contains highly productive streams and wetlands, the EPA said. In addition the geology of the area is very porous, would not contain these toxic ponds, and would further contaminate the surrounding waterways and fishery habitats.

I voice my strongest opposition to withdrawing the proposed 2014 restrictions on ""the use of certain waters in the Bristol Bay watershed for disposal of dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit."" Science can not be ignored!

The area under consideration is where half of the world's sockeye salmon population is harvested.  It is one of the last, great salmon fisheries left in the world.  If this change in regulations is allowed to go through we will be destroying this valuable population. The returning salmon and other ecological resources create some 14,000 full- and part-time jobs, generate about $480 million annually -- and support 4,000-year-old Alaska Native cultures. 

It is dangerous to even allow applications for permits for mining in this area.  Such a mine would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources in some areas of the bay watershed, It is estimated that 22 miles of streams and more than 6 square miles of wetlands and other habitats that are important to salmon and other fish would be lost to a large-scale mine. These losses would be IRREVERSIBLE.

Please do not allow the withdrawal of the restrictions to take place

The important findings of the July 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination must stand.

This area is well known as the largest natural fish hatchery of Sockeye Salmon in the world, and results in the harvesting of as many as 30 million individual fish by fisherman annually according to Alaska Fish and Game's website. This is a very significant number, as the world consumes roughly 65 million Sockeye annually, therefore this single area represents nearly half of salmon supply in the world, feeding millions of people.

Beyond those facts, the local fishing industry supports as many as 14,000 full and part-time jobs and over $400 million dollars in revenue for the local economy. Not to mention the additional revenue generated through the distribution, sale, preparation, and consumption of these fish throughout the country. The residents of the Bristol Bay area have spoken time and again in opposition to the mine. I live in Colorado and see ""No Pebble Mine"" stickers on cars even driving around here. The EPA has agreed that the proposed Pebble mine would be catastrophic to Bristol Bay's salmon and to the economic vitality of its communities, and should stand by these facts and not reverse course at this time. 

The study is being driven by the interests of a Canadian mining company who wishes to mine in the area and use the waters to dispose of dredged or fill material associated with mining from the Pebble deposit. For an administration that claims to want to put ""America First"" to pander to a Canadian mining company is beyond hypocritical.

How can anyone believe this administration is working to ""Make America Great Again"" when withdrawal of this protection directly has the potential for the elimination of 14,000 jobs and risks cutting the food supply of millions of people? These are good paying jobs for American citizens, jobs that help feed millions of people and supply half of the salmon consumed in the world. This area deserves the protections afforded to it under the July 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination, and the people of Bristol Bay deserve to keep their jobs.

I am opposing the proposed policy reversal regarding the protections for Bristol Bay. This is a critical habitat, and disruption and destruction of it would have negative impacts on US interests and on the ecosystem. For example, currently this area is one of the most productive fisheries in America. Protecting this resource maintains jobs for those in the fishing industry, those who make livings utilizing the ecosystem dependent on the salmon, such as hunters and those involved in ecotourism, and offshore fishing. Mining can completely destroy this ecosystem, since operational mines wreak havoc on the flow of the river and long term the chemicals produced in the mining leech out into the surrounding areas making them acidic wastelands. There is likely no recovery from this, except perhaps with extremely costly efforts. It is much better to make use of the renewable resources of the land in its natural state than to destroy it while stripping it of non-renewable resources that poison the area. By keeping the area federally protected, it is safe from mining considerations now and in the future. The people who live around and depend on the Bristol Bay are protected from pollution and losing their jobs. The native cultures that celebrate the life in and on the river are free to continue the lifestyles they've always known. It is important to realize that how important waterways are to the people and non-human organisms that depend on them. Where relatively untouched and healthy ecosystems exist, it is crucial to protect them. Thank you for your consideration.

I am a conservative republican leaning American.  I love my country and I love the natural outdoor
opportunities and wilderness areas that some of our prior administrations have protected.  In addition to the 
joy that comes from being able to spend time in some of these areas, these areas also
provide jobs and a way of life for thousands of other Americans.  To have pristine areas such as
Bristol Bay in Alaska as a true wilderness unfettered by human presence is a treasure not only for
current Americans but also for generations to come.

I have witnessed first hand the environmental damage caused from a long closed mining operation near
the headwaters of the Animas river in SW Colorado in August 2015.  While on vacation and fly fishing
the beautiful streams in the area including the lower Animas, a major breach occurred while the EPA was trying
to mitigate residual pollution and toxic tailings from the Gold King Mine. The river was shut down and locals had 
to rely on bottled water while paying to have their wells tested.  The river turned an ugly orange.  All from toxic 
waste from a mine that was abandoned 100 years prior.  The economic impact just on the town of Durango, where
we were staying, was significant.

Why do you feel removing protection for wilderness areas and allowing material extraction from these areas
will result in anything different than we have seen in countless other wilderness areas subjected to mining
interests?  A hundred years have passed and many of these mines are still causing huge problems.  

You can save your future colleagues and future EPA employees from future headaches!
Please do not reverse the protection afforded to wilderness areas, including Bristol Bay, by the prior administration!

Ignoring and reversing it is a waste of time and money, and incredibly disrespectful to all the parties who participated.

At stake is the largest Sockeye Salmon Fishery in the world and the livelihood of those who depend upon the salmon.    Bristol Bay is an inappropriate place for a large-scale mining operation. 
 
We should protect, not damage the Bristol Bay watershed.  EPA's mission is to protect the health of people and the environment.  We can and should do both by honoring the PD that has already been developed.

Please do not withdraw the EPA Region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination under the Clean Water Act.  It does not make sense to grant a foreign company the opportunity to extract resources from U.S. soil which would contaminate areas around the mine, destroy Salmon spawning grounds and habitat, and kill American fishing jobs.  It is the hubris of man that thinks they will contain any contamination from this mine.  If the salmon spawning grounds are destroyed in Bristol Bay, do the American people have a back up?
   
The salmon industry supports American jobs and is also part of the American sourced seafood supply, which is also dwindling.  The American people do not win out in any way.  

Please show some wisdom and do as GOD would want and not withdraw.

You cannot put a price on our environment and once we damage this earth, we may never be able to restore it. A recent article on cnn.com states: ""For more than 15 years, Northern Dynasty Minerals, a Canadian mining company, has sought to build a gold and copper mine in Bristol Bay."" The Obama administration, and rightly so, chose to protect this fragile ecosystem from such reckless development because ""Such a mine ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of the bay watershed, the EPA found after three years of peer-reviewed research. In particular, the EPA estimated 22 miles of streams and more than 6 square miles of wetlands and other habitats that are important to salmon and other fish would be lost to a large-scale mine. ""All of these losses would be irreversible,"" the agency said."" How can this agency ignore its own scientific study and try to walk back these important protections? Should this mine be established, there is no way to recover the habitat. This decision, in my opinion, would be unconscionable. Please do not allow this proposed withdrawal to proceed.

This is one of the last great natural spawning grounds for salmon in the world.  Repeated environmental impact studies have indicated that allowing mining in this region would likely result in near total destruction of the ecosystem.  This should give you pause on multiple levels.  One should ask do we as a species even have a right to destroy something that has taken millions of years to develop and likely cannot be replaced, but if notions of justice do not appeal to your sensibilities, then the economics also make no sense.  This proposal threatens a beloved, sustainable source of income and commerce for the state of Alaska that will benefit thousands of locals as well as the greater US economy in exchange for a finite operation that will ultimately uproot and deprive the surrounding communities of a means of sustainability while enriching a foreign company.  

I sincerely hope that you will consider your decisions with regard to the long term viability of the communities that have built their livelihoods on this precious natural resource and to the irreplaceable beauty of an ecosystem that can only be squandered by allowing mining here.

The tar sands project, the destruction of the Amazon, the continued cutting of old growth forests, the destruction of African savannah and poaching of its great wildlift, are all unnecessary acts considering the technology available today.  Their destruction is based on the low cost, take from the weak mentality that is destroying the last untouched wildernesses in the world today.

I urge, as a citizen of the Nation, that our lands be protected and our national and natural resources not be destroyed for the sake of private profit.

These results, while horrendous, pale in comparison to the threat to the 4000 year old Alaska Native cultures that have depended on the salmon provided by Bristol Bay.

The rivers entering Bristol Bay provide spawning habitat for the very last great migratory populations of salmon.  These rivers are essential for the survival of these salmon.  Mining operations would present an extreme risk to these ecosystems and very likely cause the collapse of the salmon populations.  

Besides being a valuable natural resource, these rivers are a financial and cultural resource to the people of Alaska and the World.  

Prohibit mining in the Bristol Bay watershed.

I'm writing to express my strong opposition to the proposal to withdraw the July 2014 Proposed Determination that was issued pursuant to the Clean Water Act. This determination was the result of three years of peer-reviewed study, which clearly documented the tremendous economic and cultural value of the Bristol Bay salmon fishery. Rejecting scientific consensus is antithetical to the EPA's mission. The Bristol Bay salmon fishery is a renewable resource that supports thousands of jobs, and generates $300 million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon. The Pebble Mine cannot be developed without significantly and irreparably degrading this vital resource. Fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources would permanently destroy one of the world's most important salmon fisheries.

The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and protect the Bristol Bay watershed. Thank you for your consideration in this matter. 

Kind Regards,
Joseph Tremonti",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Worse, the Pebble Mine has already undergone US Government review, including the Determination at issue.  Revisiting these pre-existing decisions - decisions based on best-available science (two peer reviews) that was strongly supported by local communities (the mine threatens thousands of jobs and tribal rights) and the greater public (1.5 million comments) - is a striking waste of public resources and funds.  As a member of the public and previous resident of Alaska, cease these efforts once and for all.  They are deeply unpopular, dangerous and unwelcome.

Not only is the decision inconsiderate in terms of the wildlife, the native populations of Alaskans are being shoved aside for the mining company's gains. These populations do not have the proper representation to fight for themselves, and with more than 25 indigenous groups in the region they need the area to stay as it is to survive how they have for years.

How can you head the EPA and work to undo the protections that the EPA has worked hard to develop?  Can't you see the harm you are doing?  How can you look in the mirror?

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

You're saying that no resource, no matter how valuable, is off-limits to development -- no matter how obviously deleterious.""
Quinn's concerns are based on his years researching the bay, which were incorporated into a 2014 EPA report on Bristol Bay under the Obama administration. The report, which also was based on Pebble's filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, estimated the total mine site could be larger than Manhattan and nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon.
Such a mine ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of the bay watershed, the EPA found after three years of peer-reviewed research. In particular, the EPA estimated 22 miles of streams and more than 6 square miles of wetlands and other habitats that are important to salmon and other fish would be lost to a large-scale mine.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

We cannot undue damage that has been done to the earth, but we can stop it from hurting certain areas.  There was a 3 year study done to see what the impact would to the area.  Then all of that is dismissed in a span of 1 hour because someone claims they can do reclamation.  When in truth something's can be  irreversible no matter how hard we wish that they were not.  This is a matter that cannot be undone and will impact the area greatly.  There are tens of thousands of fisherman jobs that would be lost when the salmon are lost and a whole culture will be impacted. How can this be replaced?  I feel that our children should have some of these places left that have not been damaged irreversibly.  And when asked why in many years, we will have to answer that we could have stopped it, but choose not to.  How many species and unique habits must we destroy before we learn our lesson.

Some of our nation's most important salmon habitat are found in Bristol Bay, which supports a 1.5 billion dollar fishery and a heavily tourism-dependent economy. The mine developers plan to build an open pit mine, putting at risk fish, wildlife and the livelihoods of people who depend on this area.

Even without a spill, mining the Pebble deposit will destroy 94 miles of salmon streams and more than 5,000 acres of wetlands, lakes, and ponds in the pristine Bristol Bay watershed.

Below please find the letter signed by our members for your consideration.

------------------------------

Dear Administrator Pruitt, 

Don't withdraw Clean Water Act restrictions for Pebble Mine! Bristol Bay provides some of our nation's most important salmon habitat, and Pebble Mine threatens not just the world's most productive sockeye salmon run, but the people, jobs and wildlife thriving in the region.

Thank you for considering this public input on Pebble Mine and protecting salmon habitat.

Sincerely,

RE: Bristol Bay, Alaska/Pebble Mine - Docket: EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369

Dear Administrator Pruitt and Acting Region 10 Administrator Pirzadeh:

I am a supporter of Slow Food USA, the national, not-for-profit organization dedicated to a food chain that is good, clean, and fair for all.  I write to urge the US Environmental Protection Agency to protect Bristol Bay, Alaska, from the Pebble Mine that would threaten the region's irreplaceable fish and wildlife resources and the 14,000 jobs that depend on Bristol Bay's clean, healthy waters and fishery.  EPA must keep in place the 2014 Bristol Bay 404(c) Proposed Determination.

According to EPA study, the Bristol Bay watershed provides vital habitat for 29 fish species, more than 190 bird species, and more than 40 terrestrial animals. All five species of Pacific salmonsockeye, Chinook, coho, chum, and pinkspawn and rear in the pristine Bristol Bay watershed. The Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, producing approximately 46% of the world's wild sockeye harvest, creating $1.5 billion in economic output and nearly 20,000 jobs throughout the United States annually.

EPA's scientific study contains highly concerning facts about the proposed Pebble Mine: even without a mine disaster, exploitation of the Pebble deposit will destroy 94 miles of salmon streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, lakes, and ponds. Overall, EPA concluded that mining the headwaters of the Bristol Bay river systems could cause irreparable harm to the valuable Bristol Bay fishery, wildlife, and communities.

I stand with more than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen who oppose the Pebble Mine.  Because of its great, ecological, economic, and cultural value, I implore the EPA to stand with us by keeping in place the 404(c) Proposed Determination for Bristol Bay, Southwest Alaska.

Thank you for your attention.

I am writing to express my deep concern of the EPA's proposal to reverse decisions made during the Obama administration regarding mining in the Bristol Bay region of Alaska. The health of the endemic salmon population needs to be prioritized over the private interests of the Pebble Partnership. Bristol Bay provides about half of the world's catch of sockeye salmon and is one of the last large scale sustainable fisheries in the United States. 
 
According to a recent University of Alaska study, the Bristol Bay fishery is worth 1.5 billion and supports 10,000 auxiliary jobs. If the fishery is continuously managed properly, and is not affected by the potentially devastating impacts of mining activity, the fishery will continue to generate revenue on the scale of billions. While the worth of the minerals may be large in the short run, in contrast to the salmon fishery, the mineral reserve is finite and will soon be depleted. Additionally, the mining activity is projected to generate only 1,000 jobs compared to the 10,00 already supported by the fishery. 
 
The Bristol Bay fishery and Pebble Mine unfortunately cannot co-exist. Mining activities in the area will permanently mar the environment, leading to a collapse of the salmon fishery.
 
Though this is wrongly framed as a partisan issue, the American people need to understand that this should be in everyone's best interest. It is not hard to understand that protecting an established, prolific, renewable resource is paramount compared to catering to a temporary, non-renewable industry. 
 
I implore the EPA to refrain from making a nearsighted decision and to consider the undeniable benefit of prohibiting mining in the Bristol Bay region to protect the long term health of the salmon fishery  

Thank you for reading this comment and taking into account public opinion on this important issue.

My name is Payton Hammer and I am a senior at Humboldt State University. I am studying environmental economics and have a minor in Natural Resources and Management Planning. I am commenting on the EPA's decision to withdraw the 2014 proposed determination of the Pebble Mine near the head waters of the Bristol Bay watershed. Proposal to Withdraw Proposed Determination to Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, 82 Fed. Reg. 44,176 (July 19, 2017). I think that the proposed pebble mine deserves to be able to take all the steps necessary to see if they can go through with this proposed mine, however, I do not support the mine at all and would need substantial evidence from an EIS. The risks are far greater than the benefits and if the EPA approves this project I will be deeply disappointed in the EPA under our current administration.
First, I would like to address that I think Northern Dynasty Minerals does not have the right to go through the Environmental Impact assessment process. The EPA has already struck down the Pebble Mine project under section 404 (c) of the Clean Water Act which restricts any discharges of dredged materials into wetlands or watersheds. The environmental impacts of a mine as large as this is going to have an immense impact on the environment around it. I would also like to comment on the fact that in Alaska there has been strong resistance against the mine from the very beginning. Most Alaskans think the mine is a bad idea and will have adverse economic and environmental effect.
The proposed Pebble Mine is a gross misjudgment that if goes through with the development will result in an environmental, economic and spiritual tragedy. Bristol Bay is a billion dollar fishery that provides over 14,000 full and part time jobs. Bristol bay and the Kvichak and Nushagak Rivers are home to all five of the pacific salmon species and is the only places in the world with a fully functioning salmon based ecosystem. The Kvichak and Nushagak watersheds are home to Native Americans who, like their ancestors whom have lived there for over 4,000 years, live a sustainable way of life based on the annual salmon runs. 
The people of Bristol Bay are dependent on the annual salmon runs either for subsistence or a wage and if the pebble mine is allowed to go through it will have serious consequences on the people. We cannot allow the idea of short term monetary gain win out against one of the sustainable ecosystems in the world.

I work at the Alaska Dept. of Fish & Game, so I see every day how important both commercial and sport fisheries are to Alaskans across the state; commercial fishing is a major part of our economy, many Alaskans rely on subsistence fishing, and our fisheries are a cornerstone of our equally important tourism economy.

Because of the proximity to the watershed this will threaten the salmon industry (1.5 billion, 14000 jobs in Bristol Bay area). 

This disregard for shared natural resources and the environment as a whole is concerning. This administration's continued emphasis on short-sighted, mercenary profitability at the expense of any kind of responsible stewardship is callous, cruel, and purely driven by greed.

One thing that I think is overlooked here, aside from the non-zero possibility of destroying one of Alaska's most important resources, is the almost certainty of destroying or diminishing Alaska's brand.

To most people, Alaska is synonymous with wild, natural, and pristine.  The branding of many products is based on this, from Wild Alaskan Salmon to Alaskan Adventure Cruises, promising products and services from an untouched and untarnished last frontier.  The unique thing about a brand is that it can be diminished by the perception of the consumer, even if no actual change in the product has occurred.  Whatever the risks of mining in Bristol Bay are - small or large - we can all agree that there is no such thing as a zero risk.  Just the perception that there may be some small chance of contamination from the mine is antithetical to the natural and pristine qualities that the Alaska brand is built on.  Especially in such a highly public ruling, creation of Pebble Mine - even without a catastrophic spill - could therefore diminish the value of all products and services that rely on Alaska's reputation and branding for their commercial worth.  A good example is the ripple effects from the Exxon Valdez spill - it was not just commerce in the Prince William Sound that was effected, but many others were harmed as well from the perception of that contamination.  

Who owns the Alaska brand is another parallel question - one could argue it is the state, or all the people in the state (the majority of which are opposed to the mine), but I think there also could be a strong argument that the original owners are the Alaska Native population - and obviously the vast majority of Native organizations oppose the construction of Pebble Mine.

My family is originally from Butte, Montana, a current Superfund site and previous copper mining town.  It was, briefly, one of the richest cities in the state because of the mine.  Now, it has had an incredibly depressed economy for many many years.  The mine site (Berkeley Pit) has left behind an uncleanable pool of perpetual water so toxic that every couple years a migrating flock of geese land in it and then die by the hundreds, their bodies dropping all over town.  Even if there is a 1:1,000,000 chance of that happening in Bristol Bay, it would be a catastrophe that would never be repairable - or forgivable.

Please, do not trade the identity of an entire state and multiple cultures for the possibility of big profits and 1,000 temporary jobs.

The fishery, in addition to supporting many jobs and the local economy, is worth untold amounts in ecosystem services. The salmon are vital to tribal traditions and provide food to many people. 

Tourism, a vital part of the local economy, would be greatly damaged. Having lived in Butte, Montana, the home of the largest Superfund site, I can personally attest to how mining (and a view of the mine's remains - sickly yellow strip-mined terraces of destroyed earth) keep tourists from visiting the area.

The proposed mine would provide jobs for a VERY SHORT time but its detrimental effects would be long-lasting. Please do NOT prioritize short-term gain over long-term environmental impacts, which will no doubt cost far more to clean up than the mine will make in profits! Destroying the way of life for many people and the fishery for decades to come is not worth it! 

Look at the costs of mining in Lake Superior - I recommend Nancy Langston's book ""Sustaining Lake Superior"" for an in-depth examination of mining's effects on the lake and fishery. We should not repeat the mistakes of the past.

Oh, and another thing, you will also have to replace the $300 million annually that the EPA acknowledges is produced by the direct sales of commercially caught salmon.  

Northern Dynasty Minerals, Ltd. is a Canadian company.  Not even an American company.

Now the loss tally seems to be:

I am writing to urge you to retain the current regulations restricting the use of rivers in the area of the proposed Pebble Mine.  This mine is an extremely bad idea, situated at the headwaters of the most important salmon fishery in the world.  The Bristol Bay salmon fishery employs thousands and those fish are vitally important to local wildlife as well.  And the mine itself would destroy a pristine area which should be protected.

All mines have the potential for disaster (e.g. the recent Mt. Polley mine disaster in British Columbia).  A disaster in the Pebble deposit area would destroy the last great salmon fishery on the planet.  

Please do not put short term profits of the mine owners ahead of ecological integrity, a robust salmon fishery, and the thousands of people who depend on it for their livelihood.  The Pebble Mine is a terrible idea and should not be allowed to proceed.

Administer E. Scott Pruitt

Dear Administrator Pruitt,

It would be a mistake to jeopardize one of the last pristine salmon fisheries for the short term gains of allowing a copper mine to operate in the area. This mine would very likely create a new Superfund site that would cost tax payers millions of dollars. Not worth it!

Rigorous scientific study over the course of many years show clearly that the mine will negatively impact the area. Local communities are against it, including many of Alaskas indigenous people. This would directly impact their heritage and local economy. Salmon, if managed properly, are a renewable resource. Putting the short-term gains of mining a non-renewable resource ahead of a fishery that would continue to produce long after the copper deposits have been extracted and all thats left is the toxic waste. 

The EPA has already determined that the Pebble Mine would have significant and adverse effects on this pristine salmon fishery. The EPA has already considered the contributions of this salmon fishery on the local economy, with direct sales generating ~$300 million annually, and creating 11,000 jobs, many of which are held by Alaskan Natives. The EPA should continue to protect the Bristol Bay watershed and preserve this fishery.

Sincerely,

I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment with the EPA's plan to to reverse course and green-light the proposed Pebble Mine, despite the catastrophic risks it poses to Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed, its world-renowned salmon runs, and its Native communities. 

I was fortunate enough to spend three years as a resident of Bristol Bay. I worked as a legal aid attorney in Dillingham and traveled throughout the region to meet with clients in every one of the Alaska Native villages. To say this region is unique is an understatement of staggering proportion. Bristol Bay, especially the regions surrounding the Nushagak and Kvichak Rivers, is the most pristine and painfully breathtaking place I have ever been. It is also the most productive salmon ecosystem in North America, and it is unmatched in its productivity. All five species of Pacific salmonsockeye, Chinook, coho, chum, and pinkspawn and rear in the Bristol Bay watershed, supporting wildlife like brown bears and eagles, as well as human industry and culture. The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, producing about 46% of the world's wild sockeye harvest. It generates $1.5 billion a year and provides nearly 20,000 jobs throughout the United States annually. Over 4,000 locals, including many native Yup'ik and Dena'ina, rely on fish, moose, and other subsistence foods for 80% of their protein. 

In the Spring of 2012 I traveled to Kokhanok, Igiugig, and Iliamna. I saw the location of Pebble's proposed mine and there is no way that a mine in this area, right near the headwaters of the two greatest salmon-producing rivers in North America, will result in anything less than complete destruction of the fishery. Whether it happens in year one or year five, something will go wrong and when it does, there's no turning back. And even if everything goes right, the inevitable consequences of large scale mining on an ecosystem are incompatible with marine life. Salmon are extremely sensitive to their environment and the smallest increase in water temperature, pH or turbidity can be catastrophic.  

In addition to the inevitable decimation of the salmon population, if a mine is allowed to proceed in this region, there will be similar consequences for the human population. When the Pebble people came into Bristol Bay, it was like a cancer. They started buying off communities and stakeholders in an attempt to gain favor, while all the while planning to rob them of their most valued resource - their fish. Pebble doesn't care about the lives of Alaska Natives, it only cares about profits and when the profits dry up, they will pull out of the region and leave behind a mess that's impossible to clean up. 

President Obama's Environmental Protection Agency proposed common-sense restrictions that would have banned this dangerous mine because of the obvious environmental risks it would pose. The EPA's recent settlement with Northern Dynasty Minerals to reverse those common-sense restrictions is a blatant giveaway to the mining industry at the expense of the American people, our environment, and our economy.

More than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen oppose the mine.

I urge you to listen to those voices, and for the sake of the Bristol Bay watershed, its world-class salmon fishery, and its people, keep the door closed on Pebble Mine. If you don't, you will have to answer to me and hundreds of thousands of people in Alaska and across the United States and the world who stand in fervent opposition to this toxic mega-mine.

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

Many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical (much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats) and poses its own environmental risks. I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery. 

Sincerely, 
Piper Gordon

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

The long term sustainability of the fishery is much more valuable to the region than allowing the mining of gold and copper and all the environmental devastation that comes with it. The decision published on July 21, 2014 is well supported and vetted. This attempt to undo that is serving special interests and is an unreasonable action trying to reverse environmental protections, which is the EPA's job,  in favor of mining operations that are not sustainable and only will only benefit a few. With the state of the Pacific salmon species and the fact that gold and copper aren't threatened in the way these salmon are, some choices need to be made.

To Whom It May Concern,
I am strongly opposed to the proposed withdrawal of the Proposed Determination to Restrict Use for the Pebble Partnership.
Application of the Clean Water Act is appropriate for the watershed(s) of Bristol Bay, as evidenced by the extensive scientific and social research that went in to to decision to prevent the development of the Pebble Mine.
Bristol Bay represents the largest salmon fishery in the United States, and provides thousands of jobs across the entire region.  Fishing fleets based as far away as Seattle and throughout southeast Alaska provide SUSTAINABLE jobs directly and indirectly through manufacturing, maintenance and support of the fishery.  These jobs are not ""boom and bust"" as are mining jobs--the fishery jobs are generational, promising employment decade after decade.  As well, the fish themselves provide food for millions of people across the world, most notably in the United States.
Meanwhile, mining has a tragic and terrible environmental record, leaving vast areas contaminated, always leaving taxpayers to pay the bills for ""cleanup"" long after the minerals are taken and the mining companies have left.  Every mine, even in modern history has resulted in significant environmental degradation that taxpayers, not the mining companies have to pay to mitigate (note:  not clean up since it is impossible to clean up such material/sites).  Factor in that many foreign companies come to the United States, take billions of dollars worth of minerals and pay pennies on the millions as ""royalties"" and this is a terrible ""lose-lose"" for the taxpayers and citizens of the United States.
Do NOT ALLOW PEBBLE MINE.
Thanks for the opportunity to comment.

My name is Reba Temple and I live in Homer, Alaska. I am a third generation Alaskan fisherman and started fishing with my family in Bristol Bay in 2004. I now have my own operation and hope to continue fishing with my children and grandchildren for years to come. After spending every summer in Bristol Bay since 2004, I can truly say there is nowhere else in Alaska that holds such a special place in my heart. 

Salmon continue to return each summer to the headwaters of Bristol Bay due to the fact that the waters are so pristine. This is something that is increasingly rare in today's world, as we see run after run of salmon failing as their natal streams are compromised. The salmon that return to Bristol Bay each summer provide for the animals of the region. They provide for the subsistence ways of life of the Yup'ik, Dena'ina, and Alutiq indigenous peoples of the region. They provide for the economy, as over 14,000 people come to the region to harvest salmon and support the fishing industry each summer. This is last great salmon run in the world and we must not take any chances with it. 

Putting a mine, of any size, at the headwaters of Bristol Bay is putting the well-being of these animals, locals, and fishermen who depend on the fishery in danger. But most importantly, we are gambling with the future of the salmon. We must not put them in harm's way. We must preserve the pristine waters that have existed in Bristol Bay for thousands of years. Please listen to the people of Alaska. There is nothing that Alaskans value more than clean water and healthy salmon. Please do not withdraw or rescind the Proposed Determination for Docket EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369. Instead, please finalize the protections for the last great wild-sockeye salmon fishery on the planet.

No doubt a great many people have already pointed out to you the utter foolishness of withdrawing protection from the Pebble Deposit Area from a scientific and humanitarian standpoint. Endangering a vital cultural heritage and one of the finest remaining salmon runs in the world is clearly a violation of the EPA's mission and trust. But while you may wish to justify your decision on economic grounds, it is also foolish in that regard. Providing a handful of jobs, mostly temporary, and benefiting a single mining company cannot provide the same level of long-term economic reward as maintaining a unique, renewable natural resource, especially in a world where overfishing and ongoing oceanic pollution are likely to raise the demand on remaining wild fish stocks.

Moreover, you are part of an administration that promised to cut government waste and cronyism. Every time a permit is filed with regard to mining in this area and has to be denied (see utter foolishness from a scientific standpoint, above) that is simply useless time spent spinning the wheels of government employees, wasting money. Since, from any logical standpoint, every permit for this are should and must be denied, far better that they are never filed in the first place.

Please do the sensible thing and retain the existing protections for this area.

It is clear that the reversal has nothing to do with the carefully thought out process, with the goal of the EPA, or with any consideration of weighting of industrial development vs. effects on ecosystems and fisheries.

Bristol Bay is the last major pristine salmon habitat left in North America, and supports the most valuable salmon fishery in the world, worth in excess of $400 million a year, in addition to substantial native Alaskan traditions and sustenance. It deserves more than this.

Dear Administrator Pruitt, 

It's unfortunate that science is ignored once gain.  In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency, then under more credible leadership, took on a rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific study of the proposal for the Bristol Bay watershed, concluding that the proposed mine would have unacceptable adverse effects on the rich salmon fishery. After completing this study, the EPA in 2014 proposed new restrictions needed to protect the habitat. This is not a case of ""excessive regulation"". This is minimal support of a vital ecosystem. Please do not allow the mining to move forward. I write in support of the communities of Alaska's Bristol Bay and ask you not to withdraw the proposed determination to adopt restrictions protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon. The proposed determination was made at the request of local communities and adopted only after years of rigorous scientific study, public participation and peer review. 

The EPA was correct in 2014 when it found that the Pebble Mine would have ""significant and unacceptable adverse effects"" on ""one of the most productive, pristine, valuable and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America today."" The EPA has noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300 million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon, generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon support not only the commercial and sportfishing industries, but a traditional Native way of life that has endured for millennia and thrives today. The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and take all necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed.

I strongly agree with restrictions on the discharge of dredged or fill material from the potential mining of the Pebble deposit in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. I strongly disagree with the 2017 Proposal to Withdraw Proposed Clean Water Act Restrictions on Mining Pebble Deposit

It is unquestionable, that each and every marine and aquatic habitat is extremely sensitive to changes caused by the actions involved in human industrial endeavor. We can now see massive plastic islands growing in the oceans through our species thoughtlessness and how the resulting plastic micro- & nano-particulates are appearing throughout the marine food chain, which will severely affect our ability to consume fish safely.

By placing dredged or fill material from mining into Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed, we would be placing an insurmountable challenge to the life cycle of salmon, which already have long odds against them, from one of the most arduous reproductive cycles of any species.

I love wild salmon. By dumping dredged or fill material from mining into Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed, you may temporarily be able to enjoy higher salmon prices, as the ability of the species to survive is impeded, but not only would I no longer be able to afford to buy wild salmon, the wild salmon industry would slowly dwindle and die with the species.

It isn't merely my diet which would be affected but, as with all intertwined and interdependent ecosystems, many other species would suffer from the loss of salmon as a food source. We cannot derive much nutrition from mined products, nor would bears try to scrape up the ground for a tasty bit soil. Salmon helps them put on the fat they need to survive the winter. When you kill off salmon, you are writing off the bears, too, in addition to the tribal/native populace which has relied upon wild salmon as a food source for thousands of years.

This is another instance where, ""Let them eat cake!"" won't be very appropriate, as species dependent upon salmon, both marine and on land, would suffer greatly at the loss.

I beg you once again, not to withdraw the 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination.

Withdrawing the 2014 protections for the region would result in devastating environmental and economic losses. If the concept of environmental protection isn't a strong enough motivator, then please at least consider the economic impact: this region is home to half of the world's Sockeye salmon fishery population. Sockeye salmon is a common product sold in grocery stores across the USA, and the Bristol Bay fishery is one of the most valuable salmon fisheries worldwide. The Bristol Bay region produces approximately half of the world's Sockeye salmon, and this salmon is distributed nationwide in the US. Here are some facts from a 2013 study for the Bristol Bay Regional Seafood Development Association:

""In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct
harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value, and was greater
than the total value of fish harvests in 41 states. Salmon processing in Bristol Bay increased the value by
$225 million, for a total first wholesale value after processing of $390 million. The total value of Bristol
Bay salmon product exports in 2010 was about $250 million, or about 6% of the total value of all U.S.

With fisheries worldwide in rapid depletion, is the economic value of withdrawing the 2014 protections really worth destroying a valuable and irreplaceable fishery? Is it worth the risk to the USA's seafood supply?",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

If the proposed determination is withdrawn, please review the decision as a separate and distinct action, not just as an administrative add-on. Withdrawing the proposed determination does not put America First. The salmon fishery in this watershed is a great American example of sustainable resource extraction, a win-win for America. A mine of any size or design would place this resource in jeopardy, for a short-term gain that does NOT Make America Great Again. It's a foreign-owned mining company. 

I question whether the administrator even has the authority to pull the agency's earlier findings. EPA is charged with implementing the Clean Water Act. It did so by enacting 404(c) under the rule of law. How can it now step away from that legal process? It is not a fair way to do regulation, to interrupt due process at the administrator's discretion.

As a US citizen who grew up in the Pacific Northwest, I am strongly against the use of our marine ecosystem as a dumping ground.

Perhaps if business is your only angle then that will be appealing enough. However I'm sure that it's only businesses that benefit you and your friends directly that are of concern. 

 In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value, and was greater than the total value of fish harvests in 41 states. Salmon processing in Bristol Bay increased the value by $225 million, for a total first wholesale value after processing of $390 million. The total value of Bristol Bay salmon product exports in 2010 was about $250 million, or about 6% of the total value of all U.S. seafood exports. 

The proposed determination was made at the request of local communities and adopted only after years of rigorous scientific study, public participation and peer review. The EPA was correct in 2014 when it found that the Pebble Mine would have ""significant and unacceptable adverse effects"" on ""one of the most productive, pristine, valuable and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America today.""

The EPA has noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300 million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon, generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon support not only the commercial and sport-fishing industries, but a traditional Native way of life that has endured for millennia and thrives today. The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and take all necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Those waters are home to fully half of the world's sockeye salmon population; these fish are hugely valuable as an economic resource (sockeye roe and flesh being among some of the most highly-prized of salmon products), and as a social resource. Native peoples rely on salmon for cultural cohesion and food; their cultures rely on the salmon, for food and for spiritual importance. 
Non-Native peoples hold thousands of jobs in the fisheries and the canneries, processing the wealth of the salmon for distribution. Thousands of human lives and jobs rely on these fish being able to come back year after year after year to their traditional grounds; these grounds must be protected. 

Additionally, sockeye are an immensely-important piece of the ecosystem. These animals form a fundamental link between the land and the ocean, transferring oceanic nutrients onto land. If you care at all for the forests, and the game animals that live within those forests, salmon must be protected; without the sockeye runs, the amount of life in the area will decrease a thousandfold. 

Hatcheries will not be able to make up the difference in salmon stocks if Bristol Bay is lost; I promise you this as a veteran of PSWAC's Main Bay Hatchery, the United States' gold-standard sockeye hatchery. Half of the world's sockeye are found here; we will all suffer if Bristol Bay is no longer able to sustain a salmon population. 

So long as there are salmon in the Bay, there will always be jobs. Mines will run dry, and will run out. If their environment is protected and taken care of, salmon are infinite. If their spawning grounds are clean, and cold, and free of dams, salmon will always come back. There will always be jobs in the harvest and the canning, jobs enough for thousands of people, with enough fish left over for subsistence fishing. 

We need sockeye salmon. We need Bristol Bay. We need clean water and fish more than we will ever need mines.

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

Many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical (much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats) and poses its own environmental risks.  Such environmental risks include ecosystem deconstruction and decay from the significant loss of the salmon population.  

I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery.

I'm writing concerning Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The risk posed by the proposed Pebble Mine cannot be ignored. It would endanger the sustainability of this essential fishery long-term. Bristol Bay represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest in 2010--that was $165 million direct harvest value in sockeye salmon. 

Salmon is known to be a healthy source of protein, vitamin D, and omega-3 fats (essential for brain and eye development in children, and linked to numerous health benefits for people of all ages). Farmed salmon is a poor substitute for wild salmon, with lower concentrations of vitamins and omega-3s and higher concentrations of saturated fats and unhealthy omega-6s. Farmed salmon also poses massive environmental risks. This is why sustainable fisheries are so important--they represent a valuable, healthy food source that we can't mimic with farmed fish.

I urge the EPA most strongly to take immediate action, and use the existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large, irreplaceable wild salmon fishery.

The region in question, Bristol Bay, is one of the largest spawning grounds for sockeye salmon in the world. And it supports the largest salmon fishery still in existence. Over 10,000 fisherman make a living providing almost half of the world's sockeye salmon harvest. Almost all of America's Pacific salmon populations have collapsed recently and are in danger of local extinction - this is the last great salmon fishery left.

To allow a mine - one run by a foreign company - to be built in this area will irreversibly destroy over six square miles of important fish habitat, not to mention the inevitable pollution of the remaining waterways by runoff. This will kill off the salmon, topple the local fishing industry, and destroy thousands of jobs. The mine would employ less than one tenth the amount of people who would lose jobs without the salmon. It would harm job growth.

Removing protections of this area to allow the construction of a mine will gravely endanger sockeye salmon, topple the local ecosystem, and destroy thousands of fishing jobs.

To develop surrounding area into a mine (1) perpetuates the constant devaluation of indigenous people, (2) disregards the importance of the Bristol Bay ecosystem, (3) emphasizes finite gain over sustainable incomes and jobs, (4) imposes corporate interests over the interests of the community at large, and (5) reminds the American public that our government prefers industrial development over environmental protection, despite comparable benefits.

(1) Building this mine and its associated processing facilities destroys the livelihoods and cultural traditions of the Yupik people and other indigenous groups that rely on the salmon and general well-being of the ecosystem. We have an infamous history in this country of constantly devaluing indigenous people and traditions and this would be yet another example of corporate and political American steamrolling these communities.

(2) No development on this scale doesn't have environmental consequences. Of course this project is utilizing the best available resources, but that doesn't negate the possible disastrous outcomes that are an underlying worry in all such endeavors. By developing in such a wilderness area as is proposed would be to reject that the wilderness and inhabitants are worth anything other than what economic utility they may provide. Ask anyone who has seen the area in its beauty--the gulls careening over the water, the alpenglow as the sun falls, or the backs of salmon slowly capping the water--and they understand the value that this place has.

(3) According to National Geographic, this mine would produce only 800-1,000 sustainable jobs, whereas the current fishing industry employs over 11,000. To argue that this project benefits the locals is a gross exaggeration. Perhaps it will bring a boost to the economy, but not in the sustainable, long-term ways that the area needs. It is also focused on extracting finite wealth. Although the overall worth of the metals in the proposed mine would be greater than the annual value of the salmon fishery, this is, again, finite wealth. Whereas the fishery wealth is a well-executed, sustainable, well-managed production. To value finite wealth over sustainable wealth and resources is to embrace the short-term mentality that gets our country into bigger issues.

(4) The mine company only proposes to hire 50% of their staff locally--a vacuous attempt at making this mine a community project. In reality, it's yet another example of America preferring corporate, industrial interests over other economic options. Other plans to improve the economy of the area include jobs and small-business ventures focused on recreation and tourism. In other words, jobs that spread the reverence and respect for the area instead of the exploitation of a mine. 

(5) Bristol Bay accounts for 50% of the world's sockeye salmon. Cook Inlet houses an endangered beluga population. And the area at large holds birds, mammals, and fish that people travel across the world to see. To prioritize industrial development over the environment has time and time again caused the United States to lose natural beauty and value. 

We constantly monetize natural resources, without accounting for the intangible and non-monetary benefits that are derived from those areas. Once a mine is developed and a fishery has collapsed, there's no going back. We cannot lose Bristol Bay.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Subject: Docket ID No. EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369

Dear Administrator Pruitt, 

I am writing in support of the communities of Alaska's Bristol Bay, the Alaskan fishing industry and the pristine and economically productive Bristol Bay watershed and ask you not to withdraw the proposed determination to adopt restrictions protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay and all the myriad activities, both commercial and recreational, that rely on the Bristol Bay watershed.  The EPA created the proposed determination after years of rigorous scientific study, public input and peer review and determined that ""unacceptable adverse effects on fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas) could result from the discharge of dredge or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit.""

According to the EPA's proposed determination ""Nearly 70% of the sockeye and large numbers of the coho, Chinook, pink and chum salmon are harvested in commercial, subsistence and recreational fisheries before they can return to their natal lakes and streams to spawn.  Thus, these salmon resources have significant economic, nutritional, cultural and recreational value, both within and beyond the Bristol Bay region.  The Bristol Bay watershed's ecological resources generated nearly $480 million in direct economic expenditures and sales and provided employment for over 14,000 full- and part-time workers in 2009.  The Bristol Bay commercial salmon fishery generates the largest component of this economic activity, with an estimated value of $300 million (sales from fishers to processors) and employment for over 11,000 full- and part-time workers (EPA 2014: Chapter 5)"".   It is obvious that the Bristol Bay watershed is indispensable and irreplaceable and must be protected!

In addition, the EPA's estimates of potential damage created by mining at the head of the Bristol Bay watershed, for even the smallest mine (0.25 stage mine) proposed by Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. (NDM), would be significant.  Habitat losses would ""include nearly 24 miles of streams, representing approximately 5 miles of streams with documented androgynous fish occurrence and 19 miles of tributaries of those streams (EPA 2014: Chapter 7).  Total habitat losses would also include more than 1,200 acres of wetlands, lakes and ponds"".  And yet, according to the EPA, ""NDM has stated to the public that ""the Pebble deposit supports open pit mining utilizing conventional drill, blast and truck-haul methods, with an initial mine life of 25 years and potential mine extensions to 78 years and beyond""  (NDM 2011).  This statement, along with others to investors, indicates that NDM is actively considering a mine size between 2.0 and 6.5 billion tons.""  A mine that could potentially be 26 times larger!!

In assessing the potential adverse effects to the area the EPA findings have been underestimated as ""This evaluation does not include footprint impacts associated with all of the components necessary to construct and operate such a mine (e.g., a major transportation corridor, pipelines, a power-generating station, wastewater, treatment plants, housing and support services for workers, administrative offices, and other infrastructure). It also does not rely upon impacts resulting from potential accidents and failures"".  Given the proposed duration of the mine's operations, 25 to 78 years, it is not unreasonable to assume that an accident would occur especially in ""such a geographically remote area subject to climate extremes"" and that and accident or failure ""would have profound ecological ramifications"".

The Bristol Bay watershed is an ecological, economical and culturally significant American natural resource and any damage done by allowing an open pit mine, as proposed by NDM, would be irreversible.  Therefore I urge you in the strongest language possible stand by the EPA's proposed determination and take all necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed for generations of Americans to come.

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

Many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical (much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats) and poses its own environmental risks.

In addition, mine waste is incredibly toxic to the environment. Many superfund sites are former mining sites (as I am certain you are aware), and even those that are not pose substantial risks to the environment. Copper and gold mines are some of the mines that are particularly damaging, as copper and gold ores are usually sulfides. Sulfide ore tailings are a major contributor to the acidification of local waters due to the formation of sulfuric acid, to say nothing of the damage that gold and copper ions cause to animal and fish life in waters. Due to all of the above, I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery.

Salmon are a valuable commodity and this bay, one of their largest breeding areas, must be left intact both for their health and ours. With overfishing already a serious concern for our fishing markets, we can't afford to lose this area.

The salmon industry is a key economic pillar of the communities surrounding Bristol Bay, and the pollution that this proposal would cause would result in the loss of jobs and livelihoods for these communities.

It is incumbent upon EPA Director Pruitt as a representative of the People of the United States to fairly evaluate any decisions made, let alone decisions that affect the largest wild Sockeye Salmon fishery IN THE WORLD and people who depend upon them for their livelihood.  The indigenous people in the Bristol Bay area depend upon these salmon within their culture for food, jobs, and have done so for over 10,000 years.  The book written by David Montgomery entitled King of Fish lays out in very plain language why we as Americans and Alaskans are responsible for ensuring that the last place for wild salmon IN THE WORLD protect its salmon fishery.  It is entirely irresponsible for any mining company to establish an open pit mine - no matter the size - in the Headwaters of Bristol Bay.  I urge Director Pruitt to reverse his decision.

Allowing the Pebble Mineral Partnership to build mineral mines and use Bristol Bay as a disposal site for dredge materials would have negative consequences for the entire region. Dumping waste materials in the water would drastically reduce water quality and decimate the local Sockeye salmon population. This would prove disastrous for the local ecosystem, and potentially endanger an entire species in one blow. 

Not only would this decision have ecological consequences, but the local fishing industry would for all intents and purposes be lost as well, costing jobs for potentially thousands of people. The Bay is home to half the world's Sockeye salmon, and losing the fisheries here would cost Alaska nearly half its total harvested salmon, as well as millions in revenue and wholesale value. Fish harvested from the Bay total more fish than from 41 other states, and 6% of US fish exports. If this area shouldn't be protected on the basis of ecological standards alone, it is too economically significant to lose in addition to environmental concerns. 

Therefore, I strongly urge for you to not withdraw this determination restricting the use of the area as a disposal site. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

Many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical (much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats) and poses its own environmental risks. The livelihoods of many Alaskan, AMERICAN families would be destroyed and their health would be negatively affected. I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery.

Dear EPA: 

I am writing in opposition to the proposal to open a mining area near Bristol  Bay, Alaska.  Specifically, I am writing during the public comment period regarding the deal with Northern Dynasty Minerals.  

Having fished commercially for salmon in Bristol Bay, I have seen first hand the beauty and abundance of that amazing natural resource.  I have seen how thousands come to harvest salmon not only for US citizens, but as an important American export around the world.  The prime attraction to foreign buyers when I was there was the pristine natural surroundings that led to such healthy, nutritious fish.  A mine next to our world-famous fishery makes no business sense at allit will damage or kill the clean Alaskan brand that has been carefully cultivated over decades.

I understand that the EPA is more interested in accessing natural resources for business and entrepreneurship than in previous years, and I understand this shift.  But trading a short-term gain in miningone that will disappear in a decade and provide far fewer jobs than you might expect due to mechanization of today's mining operationsis not smart business.

The role of EPA is not only to protect natural resources, but to balance the interests of business with the needs of the natural world to continue to sustain our nation's preeminence in the world.  We want to stay number one!  But Bristol Bay is the biggest, most productive salmon run in the world.  Trading that away to a mining company is, to put it simply, dumb.  Use your role as EPA to maintain Alaskan fisheries. Don't let mining spoil this incredible resource.

Sincerely,


Alexander Mathews

I am writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to this important fishery, and to all the people and businesses that rely on it. Salmon are a valuable commodity and this bay is one of their largest breeding areas. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

Many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical and poses its own environmental risks. I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery.

Sincerely, 
Angela Hansen

Please do not withdraw the 2014 restriction protecting clean water in Pebble Deposit area, one of the largest salmon fisheries in the world.  

To do so would allow the watershed to become polluted through potential industry use, adversely affecting the environment--worth protecting in its own right--and environmental capital, in the form of jobs dependent on a health fishery in this area.  

Allowing industry to pollute our environment is shortsighted.  Clean water and clean air are very American child's birthright.  Any short term gains in job creation by lifting regulations are often overwhelmingly offset by long-term adverse health effects to human populations that toxic and carcinogenic pollutants cause.

Wild Pacific salmon are part of a $1 billion annual market. And the benefits of salmon in our systems are just as clear: nutrient-rich soils for bountiful crops, reduced soil erosion for more arable farmland, hundreds of jobs from hatcheries to tourism to salmon harvesting. And in Washington state, we've already seen the benefits when salmon are just barely reintroduced - and how quickly those same benefits can be lost.

Bristol Bay is one of the most critical Pacific salmon habitats on the West Coast. Anything that risks our current precarious salmon populations risks incalculable damage to our environment, health, and future jobs. We literally cannot measure the economic devastation mining in Bristol Bay, and we should never have to.

The allowing of a Canadian owned subsidiary company to mine resources from American land while destroying both American wildlife & jobs while polluting and irreversibly poisoning American soil and waterways is inconsistent with the values and beliefs of American citizens across the rest of our great nation. Allowing Dynasty's subsidiary Pebble to come in and destroy a thriving economy and the land is wrong and will in no way benefit the United States or its economy. Please consider the downstream effects of what you are proposing to allow on this piece of land. If it will harm United States Citizens' livelihoods and affect the overall health of the surrounding human and wildlife populations then it is a bad idea to place a mine within the bounds of the Bristol Bay, AK watershed, regardless of what entity claims ownership of that stretch of land. I ask you to consider the future of the surrounding land and people before allowing any mining action in this area. Any profits that this mining company will make from mining here will go straight into its own pockets and no one in the surrounding area will benefit from a mine being placed here. Action of claiming a few billion dollars worth of resources over the life of this mine is incredibly shortsighted in comparison to the multi-billion dollar a year economy that this area currently supports - a multi-billion dollar per year economy that depends on the health and welfare of the wildlife living in it. Keeping certain federal regulations in place is not counterproductive to business interests in AK, especially when those regulations are creating very productive conditions for the current businesses and industries already present and in compliance with said clean water regulations. Lifting regulations in favor of a foreign company's shortsighted to make a quick dollar on US land is not excercising good stewardship of the land or taking care of US Citizens.

This watershed is extremely important for current Native Alaskan populations, and for the local fish populations. From the 2014 determination, Bristol Bay ""is an area of unparalleled ecological value, boasting salmon diversity and productivity unrivaled anywhere in North America."" (1) Not only is the area a draw for tourism, both for it's beauty and for recreational fishing, many important salmon species call the bay home. Adding mine tailings and slag to this watershed will irreparably harm this ecosystem. Even with certain containment practices in place, the run off from the mine and the likelihood of containment failure means heavy metals will end up in the water. We have already studies how lipophillic metals and compounds bioaccumulate into our fish, then end up in our bodies. Even if concentrations are low, people would likely become scared of fishing in that area, or eating the fish there, and it would cost the overall economy much more than any potential gain. The modest positive impact from jobs at the mine will pale in comparison to the possible loss that could occur to both fishing and travel industries.

It is extremely clear based upon the 2014 proposed determination by the EPA, even when given the chance to, neither party was able to sufficiently prove that the mining slag wouldn't harm the environment:

""Both NDM/PLP and the State of Alaska submitted information that raised scientific and technical issues, most of which had been previously raised in public comments on the Bristol Bay Assessment. However, this information did not demonstrate to the satisfaction of EPA Region 10 that no unacceptable adverse effects on fishery areas will occur should the disposal of dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit proceed."" (1) 

Read simply: Neither party submitted information able to demonstrate that no unacceptable adverse effects will occur. It is clear that withdrawing the restriction will have horrible negative impacts to the local ecosystem, water quality, fishing and tourism industries and the people living in the area. For these reasons, I urge you not to turn your back on clean water.

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

As a citizen working on sockeye salmon restoration in the state of Washington, I have seen firsthand the impacts of extirpated salmon runs on local communities. Loss of sockeye violated the treaty rights of the Yakama Nation and threatened their cultural practices. Headwater forest habitats have declined in recent decades due to a lack of marine nutrients that would normally be provided by salmon spawning and dying in their natal streams. Salmon carcasses provide an important source of food for bears, wolves, coyotes, raccoons, bobcats and cougars, and also host insect life that support other fish and bird species. Salmon are truly the building block of northwestern ecology and economies. Threatening them threatens all aspects of life in this region.

I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery. 

Sincerely, 
Nicole Pasi

Unmined lands in Alaska are a vital part of the natural world that is left in the U.S. To mine here would be an assault against the ecosystems prevalent there, and the livelihoods of those who depend on salmon fisheries. These salmon fisheries are abundant and exponentially increasing in this location and would be destroyed by a mining project. The losses would be irreversible. For one, the salmon provide a commercial industry for the U.S. that would be totally, irreversibly torn apart by mining. For another the natural ecosystem is one of the exquisite natural lands that is important for maintaining the earth environment which Americans live in. In other words without a stable river system our drinking water and hydroelectric power is endangered. Also mining would threaten groundwater if leaks occurred. In conclusion I ask that you don't go forward with this proposal to mine in Bristol bay.

The Bristol Bay fishery represents close to one-third of the world's Sockeye Salmon fishery by gross tonnage (Alaska Dept. of Fish and Game)

This proposal to withdraw the determination was launched at the request of the CEO of the mining company as evidenced by the decision's proximity (within an hour) to the EPA Administrator's meeting with Pebble CEO, Tom Collier (""Democrats call EPA's Bristol Bay move 'inconsistent with basic logic', CNN, October 11, 2017, https://apple.news/ALLhK0TwUT_-6sucKKvaljg).
Abandoning science and the core mission of the EPA at the behest of monied corporate and political interests is thoroughly immoral and unethical.

This proposal to withdraw should be called off and the original determination put into effect as per EPA and legal guidelines, unless and until the EPA can produce scientific, peer-reviewed, consensus research that clearly demonstrates the Pebble Mine or future mines of the same location will cause no damage to the Bristol Bay or surrounding fisheries.

of the clean water. Despite the best practices, mine tailings and retention ponds and leaks occur, if not during the short active

I am writing to urge you not to withdraw the protections afforded the Bristol Bay watershed by the Clean Water Act.  I am an Alaska commercial fisherman and aquatic scientist working within the Copper River Watershed, a sister watershed to Bristol Bay along Alaska's south central coast.  Bristol Bay is home to world's most prolific sockeye salmon run and generates more direct and indirect jobs than a proposed Pebble Mine could possibly achieve. Furthermore, the Bristol Bay fishery and its economic impacts are sustainable.  Pebble mine is finite; however, its impact on the landscape in the form of mining pits and toxic tailing pools is not, and the potential for serious ecological damage is not unrealistic if you consider the track record of open pit mines.  The permission and establishment of the Pebble Mine at the headwaters of one of our world's greatest sustainable natural treasures would be both reckless and unconscionable.  It would be a poor decision to remove the Clean Water Act protections for speculation of short term gain with great risks when a continuance of protections would guarantee what Bristol Bay has always provided, cultural and economic prosperity.

I'm writing in support of the Native communities in Bristol Bay and for everyone in the North American.  To open up Bristol Bay for Pebble Limited Partnership to mine gold and copper is a terrible and irresponsible action to take.  Leeching from the mine will wreak havoc on the waterways, the soil, the land, the wildlife and aquatic wildlife, and any other areas up and down stream of the mine, including drinking water for humans.  The damage would be irreversible.  

From an economic perspective, Bristol Bay provides thousands of jobs and generates $300 million annually from commercial caught salmon.  Why strip that away?

The EPA is supposed to be the guardian of protection against environmental pollutants and organizations, not a facilitator.  Do not reverse the findings from 2014.  Pebble Mine would have ""unacceptable adverse effects on one of the most pristine, valuable and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America today.""

I am writing to voice my objection to opening up of the permitting process for the Pebble Partnership.  

My background is in fisheries science and I completed my Masters in Science working with populations of sockeye salmon from Bristol Bay. There are three main reasons why Bristol Bay salmon and the environment there should be protected, especially from an enormous open pit mine.  

The first main reason is an ecological one. Bristol Bay is perhaps the most intact, productive large-scale freshwater system in North America.  It's not difficult to see why. Tens of millions of salmon return annually bringing nutrients they've spent a lifetime accumulating in the ocean. This pulse of nutrients from the sea is the basis of a food web that spans freshwater and terrestrial environments and ranges from microscopic invertebrates to keystone species like brown bears. They key ingredient in all of this is the salmon, without them the entire ecological system would cease to exist as it has for millions of years.

The second reason for protection of Bristol Bay is an economic argument.  Bristol Bay supports one of the largest commercial fisheries in the world and is responsible for the majority of sockeye salmon taken to market in the US.  The salmon fishery and associated industries (processors, marine suppliers, boat mechanics, etc.) support 14000+ jobs annually and are responsible for a multi-hundred million dollar economy every year.  Better yet, sockeye salmon are a sustainable resource that if managed properly can support this economy in perpetuity.  Furthermore, the sockeye salmon fishery is also considered one of the most sustainable fisheries in the world. Managers are able to determine which stocks within the larger fishery appear to be preforming well on a year-to-year basis, which allows an adaptive fishery to shift efforts to stocks with the most robust returns while leaving other, less bountiful stocks with lower pressure.  It is a model system for managers and industry. Beyond the commercial fishery, sockeye salmon as the basis for a productive food web, contribute to one of the premier sport fisheries in the US, where individuals may spend up to $20,000 over ten days to fly out to, float on, and fish for salmon and trout.

The final reason for not following through with the permitting of the Pebble Project is a cultural one. For Native Alaskans in Bristol Bay, sockeye salmon have been the lifeblood for their table, culture, and spiritual ceremonies for tens of thousands of years.  We rail against the destruction of ancient artifacts and holy relics when it occurs in other nations, but the loss of these fish would amount to the loss of the foundation of culture and faith in the region.  Beyond Native Alaskans, salmon and natural productivity and beauty are defining characters of life and culture in Alaska.  It's why people move and stay there. Alaska is perhaps the most unique state in the Union, its character largely driven by places like Bristol Bay.

Finally, a few parting notes. First, this issue was largely settled until Administrator Pruitt sat down for a brief meeting with leader of the Pebble Partnership. While I understand that these actions may be in the purview of the agency, I also note that the EPA previously decided to protect the region with an uncommon regulatory option of the Clean Water Act. Supporters of the Pebble Mine pointed to this as an overreach of regulation.  But, for anyone who has known or visited Bristol Bay, such a remarkable place called for remarkable action.  I'll leave you with this note.  A major driver of the fear for a project like Pebble is that this particular industry (hard rock mining) has had very little accountability and one of the poorest track records for environmental regard.  The Berkeley Pit Mine in Butte Montana was built on the headwaters of Clark Fork River.  The mine poisoned the river and the region's residents for generations.  When the mine became unprofitable, ownership shuttered their doors, leaving Montanans to deal with the mess and Americans to pick up the check (now approaching $50 billion). This story has been repeated time and time again for mega-project open-pit mines. Even more recently, the tailings dam of the Mt. Polley mine burst on a tributary of the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada, flooding BC's most productive sockeye salmon river with billions of gallons of toxic sludge.  Moreover, the toxic byproduct of projects like these are expected to be stored on the landscape in perpetuity.  How will the Pebble Partnership keep these toxic elements from this pristine landscape 1000 years from now when they no longer exist as a business.  Mine tailings always outlive the companies that produced them.  You have heard plenty from Alaskans and people supporting Bristol Bay protection. Please listen.

Thank you for your consideration of these comments,

Morgan Sparks, M.S.

I am not an environmentalist.  I was born and raised and have lived my entire life in Montana where natural resources play a large role in my state and I am usually on the pro-development side of the fence.  However, the Pebble mine in the Bristol Bay drainage is a bad idea.

I have traveled the world and have witnessed some of the most amazing things mankind has been able to construct sometimes with the most basic tools.  It all pales in comparison to the vast, simple beauty of the Bristol Bay drainage.

I was fortunate enough to spend a week in the Katmai region this past summer and it was quite an education.  The entire ecosystem is dependent on one species of fish, the Sockeye salmon.  Without the annual Sockey migration there would be no bears which rely on plentiful salmon to prepare for hibernation.  There would be no gulls and birds of prey which feast on the scraps the bears leave behind.  There would be no trout that feast on the salmon eggs.  These trout are so big and healthy people from all over the globe travel to the region to catch a Bristol Bay rainbow.

As I said, I am from a state that develops its natural resources and more often than not, the extraction of these resources is not as neat and tidy as proposed.  In this case it is just flat not worth the risk of endangering this special place on our planet.  All the gold in the world is not worth messing with the Bristol Bay drainage.

No to the Pebble mine.

Keep the watersheds of the Bristol Bay pristine, for the survival of the salmon and other wildlife, and out of respect and solidarity with First Nation peoples.

2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

Pebble Mine's (temporarily?) scaled-down soft-sell abetted by the Trump administration's clear willingness to consider despoiling anything and everything - even the most irreplaceable resource or baby bears in their dens - if it can be turned into dollars or favors does nothing to change the science that lead to the proposed protections. But science seems to mean little to the Trump administration in general (maybe excepting some generals) and this Orwellian Environmental ""Protection"" Agency (established by Nixon) under Secretary Pruitt. 

The Idolatry of the Dollar and the elevation of Greed have always been facets of the American (Human) psyche, but until now, they (along with lying, boasting, bullying, and so much more) have generally been sins parents and societal leaders enjoined against rather than having the nominal leader of our nation embody and practice with such enthusiasm.

I'd encourage the EPA to not withdraw the proposed mine waste disposal restriction except that there is no point. So go ahead; energize the opposition. I have been. Thank you.

The EPA's characterization of the Bristol Bay fishery as a world class fishery deserving of protection is correct and consistent with all previous known assessments of the fishery, including the assessment of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources that supports the continued closure of the Koktuli River and Upper Talarik Creek to mineral entry under Alaska law.  We encourage the EPA not to abandon its recommendation that the waters of Bristol Bay, and in particular the Nushagak and Kvichak watersheds, be afforded the protection of the Clean Water Act consistent with the findings of An Assessment of Potential Mining Impacts on Salmon Ecosystems of Bristol Bay, Alaska.",,,,,,https://downloads.regulations.gov/EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369-4121/attachment_1.pdf,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I am a biologist and water resources engineering graduate student. 

Current proposed pebble-mining operations in Bristol Bay will violate section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act. It will also be detrimental to wildlife, fisheries, streams, wetlands, and groundwater, regardless of compensatory efforts. 

Compensatory mitigation to improve streams or wetlands in other areas of the watershed(s) would not offset degradation and alterations caused by Pebble Mine. The watershed is already one of the most pristine in the nation, and no value would come of ""improving"" any area of the watershed. Given that salmon are genetically predisposed to spawn within meters of where they hatched in a stream, the creation of additional spawning channels would not be beneficial to salmon as they are not predisposed to spawn in ""unfamiliar"" streams. Additionally, the creation of side channels for salmon spawning assumes there would be additional water to supply these streams with enough flow. Continuity of hydraulics shows that ""creating additional water"" to supply adequate flow to side channels is not possible. This would lower flows in pre-existing streams. Thus, altering and degrading pre-existing, native streams would decimate fisheries in the area.

Due to the geology and hydrology of the area, surface water and groundwater regimes are tightly linked. Contamination of groundwater will negatively affect salmon. Spawning salmon rely on cold, clean upwelling of groundwater in their streams (Hancock, 2002). Any amount of groundwater contamination can detrimentally affect salmon rearing grounds. Additionally, it has been shown that water withdrawals through groundwater wells can alter the water regime in surrounding streams such that groundwater no longer flows into streams through upwelling and hyporheic exchange. Without this groundwater inflow into streams, the quality salmon spawning grounds will deteriorate.

PLP states that they would monitor sites for a minimum of 30 years after the completion of their operation in Bristol Bay. All engineering designs (including the tailings facility) have an upper limit for design lifetime. Because 30 years is not enough time for all dredged materials and contaminated waste to neutralize, and the life of the tailings facility will eventually expire, this poses threats for surface water and groundwater. When the tailings facility fails, surface water and groundwater will become contaminated, thus threatening fish, wildlife, and the surrounding ecosystems. Any amount of further cleanup would never get affected habits back to their pristine state. 

PLP also states that mine drainage at the site will be collected within the tailings facility and sent to a treatment plant prior to discharge. Engineering and hydrology calculations have shown that the treatment plant may not meet capacity for all storm events (including the likelihood of a 1000+ year storm event). Given the longevity of the proposed mining operations, it is highly likely that the wastewater treatment plants will fail. At a minimum this could mean that the inflow to the treatment plant is greater than the outflow (due to a heavy storm event), causing an overflow of contaminated mine drainage directly to the environment. Just one contamination spill can irreversibly damage surrounding habitats and decimate fish populations.

In short, the current proposed mining operations in Bristol Bay will violate section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act. The science PLP has put into their proposed mining operation is incomplete and of poor quality. As a biologist, hydrologist, and engineer in training it is clear that the 2014 Proposed Determination of the US EPA Region 10 Pursuant to section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act must be upheld. Because of this, any further Pebble Mine plans in the Bristol Bay Area should be terminated.

Gentlemen,

The Alaska Forest Association supports the proposed decision to withdraw the July 2014 Proposed Determination from the Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment of the Pebble Deposit Area.

The Alaska Forest Association (AFA) is a non-profit business association that was formed in 1957 to represent the interests of the timber industry in Southeast Alaska. The AFA currently manages a pension program, a group health insurance program, a scholarship program for the timber industry and also sponsors the Sustainable Forestry Initiative program for Alaska.

We support the responsible development of Alaska's natural resources and we believe that development can be accomplished with minimal risk to other resources. Our environments are in a constant state of change, both natural and man-caused.  Further, the environment is not fragile and impacts from development can be minimized and, if necessary, mitigated. Even the Mount Saint Helens eruption had mostly temporary impacts on fish, wildlife and the forests surrounding the volcano (https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/mtsthelens/faq/q10.shtml).

Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

Sincerely, 
 
Owen Graham
Executive Director
Alaska Forest Association

This, like numerous other issues (climate change, food labeling, gun regulation, immigration reform, prison reform, education reform, short-term lending regulation, healthcare reform, banking regulation) remains a vexing problem primarily due to corporations' ability to curry favor with elected officials.  The corrupting influence of money in our political system is undermining our democratic traditions and discouraging Americans from voting and/or running for office.  This ominous development may well end our experiment in representative democracy unless we alter this decades-long trend.  For the sake of the republic, we must amend the US Constitution to state that corporations are not people (and do not have constitutional rights) and money is not speech (and thus can be regulated by state and/or federal campaign finance laws).  Short of accomplishing this, no other reform of significance will be achieved.  The moneyed interests will turn any reform to their benefit, often at the expense of the nation as a whole.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I am very disappointed that you plan to reverse course and green light the proposed Pebble Mine, despite the catastrophic risks it poses to Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed, its world-renowned salmon runs and its Native communities. 

Under the Obama administration, the EPA, after years of rigorous study, proposed science-based restrictions that would have banned the dangerous Pebble Mine to protect Bristol Bay from the myriad of environmental risks this massive gold and copper mine would pose. Your recent settlement with Northern Dynasty Minerals to reverse those common-sense restrictions is a blatant giveaway to the mining industry at the expense of the American people, our environment and our economy.

Bristol Bay's wild salmon fishery supports 14,000 jobs and is valued at more than $1.5 billion annually. It also supplies nearly half of the world's sockeye salmon. More than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen oppose the mine.

I urge you to listen to those voices, and for the sake of the Bristol Bay watershed, its world-class salmon fishery and its people, keep the door closed on Pebble Mine.

Dear Administrator Pruitt,

Please protect the natural ecosystems, the Native economy and lifestyle. and local wildlife. Oil and water do not mix, and mines WILL lead toxins into the environment, it's just a matter of time. Do not allow the Pebble Mine to operate in the Bristol Bay. Once it is ruined, it is gone forever.

I write in support of the communities of Alaska's Bristol Bay and ask you not to withdraw the proposed determination to adopt restrictions protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon.

The proposed determination was made at the request of local communities and adopted only after years of rigorous scientific study, public participation and peer review. The EPA was correct in 2014 when it found that the Pebble Mine would have ""significant and unacceptable adverse effects"" on ""one of the most productive, pristine, valuable and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America today.""

The EPA has noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300 million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon, generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon support not only the commercial and sportfishing industries, but a traditional Native way of life that has endured for millennia and thrives today.

The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and take all necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed.

I am writing today to encourage the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect Bristol Bay, Alaska, from the proposed Pebble Mine that would threaten the region's irreplaceable fish and wildlife resources and the 14,000 jobs that depend on Bristol Bay's clean, healthy waters. EPA must keep the Bristol Bay 404(c) Proposed Determination in place to protect Bristol Bay, its salmon, waters, people, and sustainable economy from the proposed Pebble Mine.

EPA's own scientific study contains highly concerning facts: even without a mine disaster, construction of the Pebble deposit will destroy 94 miles of salmon streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, lakes and ponds. Overall, EPA concluded that mining the headwaters of the Bristol Bay river systems could cause irreparable harm to the valuable Bristol Bay fishery, wildlife, and people.

According to the EPA's own study, the Bristol Bay watershed provides vital habitat for 29 fish species, more than 190 bird species, and more than 40 terrestrial animals. All five species of Pacific salmonsockeye, Chinook, coho, chum and pinkspawn and rear in the pristine Bristol Bay watershed. The Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, producing approximately 46% of the world's wild sockeye harvest, creating $1.5 billion in economic output and nearly 20,000 jobs throughout the United States annually.

Because of its great ecological and economic value, I recommend the EPA keep in place the 404(c) Proposed Determination for Bristol Bay, Southwest Alaska. The reasonable restrictions included in that proposal will prevent unsustainable development that would adversely impact the region's fishery, recreation and local culture.

Please keep the agency's 404(c) action in place to protect one of the nation's greatest sustainable resourcesthe Bristol Bay, Alaska, salmon fishery.

As you know, Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs. 

Please do not withdraw the proposed determination.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. 

I live in Minnesota, home of the Boundary Waters, and have helped fight expanding mining interests from damaging that sacred land from pollution. I believe this mission, to protect our natural water systems is not just something to strive for in my home, but across the country. This is why I am so concerned about the risk the Pebble Mine poses to the Bristol Bay.

In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

Many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical (much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats) and poses its own environmental risks. I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery. The EPA has been an stalwart institution in the past, protecting our citizens and the beautiful land we inhabit - please continue this tradition and protect Bristol Bay.

Dear Administrator Pruitt,

This is a very bad idea! Not only will an open pit mine scar this
beautiful land, it will negatively affect the abundant salmon
population (some of the most abundant in the world)! It will also be a
devastating blow to Native communities who rely on this salmon for
their livelihoods, as well as sustenance.
I write in support of the communities of Alaska's Bristol Bay and ask
you not to withdraw the proposed determination to adopt restrictions
protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon.
The proposed determination was made at the request of local communities
and adopted only after years of rigorous scientific study, public
participation and peer review. The EPA was correct in 2014 when it
found that the Pebble Mine would have ""significant and
unacceptable adverse effects"" on ""one of the most productive,
pristine, valuable and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America
today.""
The EPA has noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300
million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon,
generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon support not only the commercial
and sportfishing industries, but a traditional Native way of life that
has endured for millennia and thrives today.
The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and take all
necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Salmon is also one of the most popular fish people buy regularly at supermarkets and the like. Starting from the bottom and working our way up, removing all of these protections will cause FAR more harm than a copper/gold mine will ever do. 

For starters, it will destroy a whole ecosystem. It doesn't matter who does what, why they do it, or where, destroying an ecosystem is NEVER good. AFTER completely destroying an ecosystem that is vital to the areas surrounding, which will all probably begin to collapse if this mine goes in, you will be DECIMATING thousands of jobs. People who work in Bristol Bay will be out of work because of this mine, and the number is far higher than the jobs and income the mine will bring in due to the mechanization of minework. Fisheries and the like will obviously be most affected but so many more are going to be reached by this.

Thirdly, due to the loss of jobs, loss of ecosystem, and general loss of quality of the nearby environment, the people who live in Bristol Bay are going to suffer. Once again, it takes a few dozen people to monitor machinery compared to the THOUSANDS of individuals that will lose their jobs from the fishing industry alone. Putting in this mine will cause a major local recession that will likely spread further than just the Bristol Bay area. It's not just the people near the bay that will be affected, it is the people that those go to for food, clothing, cleaners, everything. Putting all these people out of work gives much less disposable income to these households. The households will then stop buying as many goods as they did before. Producers will start to lay off workers and lower production. It is simple economics, but it seems to have been overlooked in your need for removing protections out on this area for a good reason.

It does not matter whether you who reads this is Democrat, Republican, or any other party, you cannot argue that these regulations and protections were put in place without good, scientifically-backed reason.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

The Trump administration has the goal of increasing middle-class jobs and job pay.

Thousands of USA citizens work in the Alaska fisheries business, and have done so for many years. Indigenous people are doing the same, for sustenance, over eons.

It is not in the interests of the USA to put in a copper pit mine, with associated toxic waste, at the headwaters of rivers draining into Bristol Bay. Sure, there will be some short-term jobs to set up this operation, but once running, new mining automated methods will minimize jobs. When the wastes inevitably leak into the headwaters and bay, one of the most abundant fisheries in the world will be destroyed.

So not only are jobs on net lost, but a major food source will be contaminated and disappear. This situation is unconscionable. The EPA is charged with protecting the environment, not destroying it.

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

Many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical (much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats) and poses its own environmental risks. Plus, on the whole, we must protect the environment at all costs, and this will endanger not only the community of people who rely on salmon, protecting salmon for salmon's own sake is just as important. I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery.

Dear Administrator Pruitt,

This is possibly the worst location to build a copper and gold mine which would generate incredibly toxic waste. The company which proposes to build and operate the mine has already been shown to be irresponsible in the Mount Polley Mine Disaster, and I have no faith in them or anyone to conduct a mining operation without impacting the environment.

I write in support of the communities of Alaska's Bristol Bay and ask you not to withdraw the proposed determination to adopt restrictions protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon. The proposed determination was made at the request of local communities and adopted only after years of rigorous scientific study, public participation and peer review. The EPA was correct in 2014 when it found that the Pebble Mine would have ""significant and unacceptable adverse effects"" on ""one of the most productive, pristine, valuable and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America today."" 

The EPA has noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300 million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon, generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon support not only the commercial and sportfishing industries, but a traditional Native way of life that has endured for millennia and thrives today. 

The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and take all necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed.

Sincerely,

Cameron Thompson

As you know, Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs.

Clearly, Administrator Pruitt has no desire to uphold the actual mission of the EPA, or to hear concerns from constituents who actually have a stake in the pending destruction of this habitat. He took one meeting with the CFO of PLP, mulled it over for an hour without considering the multi-year study already undertaken by the EPA, and disregarded any science underpinning the original CWA designation. Here's what Pruitt had to say in his brief comments:

""We are committed to due process and the rule of law, and regulations that are 'regular.'  We understand how much the community cares about this issue, with passionate advocates on all sides.  The agreement will not guarantee or prejudge a particular outcome, but will provide Pebble a fair process for their permit application and help steer EPA away from costly and time-consuming litigation. We are committed to listening to all voices as this process unfolds.""

Who are the passionate advocates in favor of this open-pit mine? This is baffling to me. I have only heard vocal opposition to PLP's desire to rip open swaths of Bristol Bay, extract some copper and gold, and dump literally millions of tons of toxic waste into the watershed in the process. PLP and Scott Pruitt appear to be the only people delusional enough to think that this is a good idea. EPA is committed to listening to all voices? They are holding a public hearing in a town of 109 people to assure that no dissenting voices are heard. The only costly and time-consuming part of this process will be cleaning up the mess that PLP leaves behind. There is no way to create an open-pit mine in a pristine watershed, and then store tailings and acid waste behind earthen dams on a known sesimic faultline.  Good luck getting PLP to pay for cleaning up anything.

This EPA assessment concluded that, if proposed Pebble Mine operations were to be undertaken, ""It is expected that the North Fork Koktuli River ... and much of the Koktuli River would not support salmonids [that is, all forms of salmon] in the short term (less than 10 years).""  Given that the totality of the scientific evidence presented in its assessment indicates complete destruction of Salmon habitat in the watershed, under law, the EPA cannot exempt the proposed Pebble Mine from provisions of the Clean Water Act nor can the agency do anything but recommend against proposed mining operation at the Pebbles Mine.
The Bristol Bay watershed, located in southwestern Alaska, is home to 25 federally recognized tribal governments representing Alaska Native peoples who have maintained a salmon-based way of life for the last 4,000 years, at least, probably for much longer.  Clearly, large-scale mining operations in the watershed proposed by the Pebbles Mine will destroy the sustainability of Bristol Bay's world-class commercial, recreational, as well as the subsistence fisheries upon which the future of Alaska Native tribes in the watershed depends.  Given the potential impact on the way of life of Alaskan Native peoples, under law, the EPA cannot allow the proposed Pebbles Mine to move forward in any form.

The proposed Pebbles Mine project, with mineral rights, is controlled by Canadian, British, Australian, and Japanese corporations; therefore, little economic benefit will accrue to the United States yet the Alaskan people living within the watershed will bear a tremendous burden as their way of life is destroyed.

The Arguments Made by Pebble Mine Proponents Are Specious
Proponents of the Pebble Mine claim that the mine would provide significant tax revenue to the State of Alaska; however, no amount of tax revenue accruing from proposed mining operations can offset the costs that local, state, and federal governments would bear as the Bristol Bay watershed is destroyed.

Proponents of the Pebble Mine claim that the mine will create well-paying jobs in an increasingly poverty-stricken regionroughly 2,000 jobs for construction, dropping to 1,000 permanent jobs during the 30 to 60-year expected life span of the mine.  However, the returning salmon and other ecological resources of the Bristol Bay watershed creates more than 14,000 full and part-time jobs, generates approximately $480 million annually, and supports a 4,000-year-old Alaska Native way of life.
Proponents of the Pebble Mine claim that the mine would provide a domestic resource of important raw materials thus lowering the United States reliance on foreign sources.  However, because markets for these and similar raw materials are global, such claims are clearly specious.  Furthermore, such a ""domestic resource of raw materials"" does not now exist nor will mining operations at the proposed Pebble Mine create one.

EPA Must Follow Mandates Established by Law

Environment Protection Agency Mandates Established by Law
By law, it is the mandate of the EPA to protect both the health of the American people and the environment of the United States and its territories.  Protecting the American people from significant health risks requires that the EPA must develop science-based regulations that are protective of the environment, wherever people live, work, and learn.  

Assault on the Environment Protection Agency Must Stop Immediately
The Trump/Pence Administration's unnecessary assault on the EPA is against the interests of the American people in that the assault directly undermines the fundamental basis of human health; the assault promotes the continuation of the widespread pollution of critical segments of the county's environment; and, to the extent that the administration deliberately fails to uphold environmental protection law, the assault is clearly unlawful.  For the reasons cited above, the Trump/Pence Administration must immediately stop its increasingly unlawful assault on the Environmental Protection Agency and its mission!

The same geology that makes these watersheds so productive for salmon makes them completely unsuitable for trying to isolate mining wastes. Even if the 'scaled down' mine that is currently being proposed does not actually act as a foot in the door, leading to larger mining over time (as I believe it is intended to), the damage will be done, not only to the resources and cultures of Bristol Bay but to our willingness as a nation to prioritize people over profit, and long-term sustainable land use over short-term gain at far too high a price. No Pebble - not now, not ever.

Dear Administrator Pruitt,
This is a very bad idea! Not only will an open pit mine scar this
beautiful land, it will negatively affect the abundant salmon
population (some of the most abundant in the world)! It will also be a
devastating blow to Native communities who rely on this salmon for
their livelihoods, as well as sustenance.
I write in support of the communities of Alaska's Bristol Bay and ask
you not to withdraw the proposed determination to adopt restrictions
protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon.
The proposed determination was made at the request of local communities
and adopted only after years of rigorous scientific study, public
participation and peer review. The EPA was correct in 2014 when it
found that the Pebble Mine would have ""significant and
unacceptable adverse effects"" on ""one of the most productive,
pristine, valuable and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America
today.""
The EPA has noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300
million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon,
generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon support not only the commercial
and sportfishing industries, but a traditional Native way of life that
has endured for millennia and thrives today.
The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and take all
necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed.
Sincerely,
Conor Lawrence",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

 The proposed Clean Water Act determination should NOT be removed. The proposed impacts of the Pebble Mine on the Bristol Bay Area and the livelihood of those depending on it is tremendous.

The science is CLEAR:  this area is home to the largest salmon run in the world; 31 Alaskan tribes depend on this area not only for their food, but their living; this area provides habitat for 29 fish species, 190 bird species,and over  40 terrestrial animal species; all 5 species of salmon spawn and rear in the Bristol Bay watershed.

How can you believe that an open pit mine that is 7 miles in area and 3/4 mile deep will not have a NEGATIVE impact on the above statements?  What science can you send me that proves otherwise.  How can you believe that the tailings, runoff, road building, additional infrastructure will not NEGATIVELY impact human and animal existence?  Please send me the science; not the economic benefit for one company and a few investors. 

Scott Pruitt and this administration needs to look into the future of our planet and make the ethical decision for Alaska and our planet.

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. NGOS have been working hard to protect this vital wildlife area from the Pebble Mine project from years. If allowed to go through, the Pebble Mine project would prove disastrous on an ecological and economic level. This project presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. The current protections must remain in order to protect a significant sockeye salmon population. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone -- 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

For many people, the Bristol Bay area is a source of necessary sustainable income and healthy food unavailable through other means. Many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical (much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats) and poses its own environmental risks. I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery.

My name is Amy Winter and I am from Atlanta, Georgia and I am vehemently opposed to the Pebble Mine initiative for the following reasons:

The potential impacts of the proposed Pebble Mine on the health of the Bristol Bay watershed and the livelihood of thousands of people in Alaska are too great to accept:

The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world.

The watershed is home to 25 federally recognized tribal governments who have maintained a salmon-based culture and subsistence-based way of life for at least 4,000 years that would be placed in jeopardy.

The watershed's ecological resources generated nearly $480 million in direct economic expenditures and sales and provided employment for over 14,000 full- and part-time workers in 2009.4

Contrary to comments by the backers of the Pebble Mine project, EPA's watershed assessment was scientifically based and thoroughly peer-reviewed, and the public has had an extensive opportunity to comment on it. The assessment and public comments received should be key components of any future action on this issue.

The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the project.5  A statewide majority of voters also oppose it, as evidenced by the 2014 State-wide ballot measure.6

The rationale for the proposed withdrawal is flawed. Finalizing the proposed determination would provide much more regulatory certainty than withdrawing it, and a permit application is not needed to augment the factual record.

Listed below are the resources for the facts above. 

Thank you,
Amy Winter

I am outraged that you plan to reverse course and green-light the proposed Pebble Mine, despite the catastrophic risks it poses to Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed, its world-renowned salmon runs, and its Native communities. 

President Obama's Environmental Protection Agency proposed common-sense restrictions that would have banned this dangerous mine because of the obvious environmental risks it would pose. The EPA's recent settlement with Northern Dynasty Minerals to reverse those common-sense restrictions is a blatant giveaway to the mining industry at the expense of the American people, our environment, and our economy.

Bristol Bay's wild salmon fishery supports 14,000 jobs and is valued at more than $1.5 billion annually. It also supplies nearly half of the world's sockeye salmon. More than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen oppose the mine.

I urge you to listen to those voices, and for the sake of the Bristol Bay watershed, its world-class salmon fishery, and its people, keep the door closed on Pebble Mine. If you don't, you will have to answer to me and hundreds of thousands of people in Alaska and across the United States and the world who stand in fervent opposition to this toxic mega-mine.

The EPA is suppose to be a proud example of what can be accomplished when environmental concerns are weighed along with economic ones when deciding how to utilize America's resources and lands. I find it disappointing that an agency created to protect the public's interests and nature's interests in resource usage is so eager to cast them aside in favor of cowing to corporate interests. The fishery on Bristol Bay contributes half of the world's wild catch of Sockeye salmon and employs thousands of people. This fishery is an important cultural touchstone for many native peoples and is one of an ever diminishing number of ecological jewels in America. It is clear to me that Trump's appointed head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, cares little for the legacy he has been handed. In fact beyond that, he seems eager to burn it down. It is well documented that he has close ties to multiple resource extraction corporations (oil, mining, ect) and eagerly pursues their interests above all else in his dealings. This is yet another classic example of him being willing to sell a portion of America's environment off to the highest bidder. He is using taxpayer dollars to fund trips to meet with these corporations so that he may then turn around and disregard the tax payer and the natural world in his decisions. 

I urge the EPA, please hold to the agreements reached previously to protect the Bristol Bay ecosystem and environment. Steward this fishery and ecological asset into the future so that our children and grandchildren will still be able to see what a healthy salmon run looks like for years to come.

Eliminating half of the world's sockeye salmon population like this would destroy a huge amount of food business. Sockeye salmon are a popular dish. There are quite a lot of jobs that actually depend on these fish, because enough people like eating them, that to get the fish out to those people, there's a need for people to help harvest and prepare the fish (and that's not to speak of transporting, seeing as I figure that wouldn't be impacted quite as much).

We already have plenty of places to get gold, that don't have even a fraction of the negative impact on the environment or other economic sectors. But to build another mine here is irresponsible, sacrificing half of an important species population, a huge loss even without the associated economic fallout, for the comparatively small economic gains of the gold mine.

The CWA section 404 allows the EPA to override the Corp and veto the ""404 permit for dredge and fill discharge if it is having or will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas), wildlife, or recreational areas,"" (EPA). The EPA's 3 year study of the area showed negative impacts on water from the start and it's their duty to use the 404-C veto in such large scale projects, in highly valued areas, with relatively high possibilities of catastrophic events. Have no doubt that this is a highly valued area because of both its intrinsic and economic value. Extensive studies done pertaining to the environmental externalities that would be associated with mining in the area, prove over and over that mining here is a terrible decision. Also from an economic standpoint it is stated that the mine will only provide 1,000 temporary jobs, but it will threaten 14,000 commercial fishing jobs that are a part of the local salmon fishery (Bautista). While this fishing industry will likely be wiped out as the salmon spawning grounds are poisoned from the mine and its disposal site. 
So it is the EPA's duty not to withdraw the proposed determination in this case, because the Pebble Mine needs to be stopped before it even has a chance to start due to the extensive and negative impacts it would have on human-environmental health; and the health of the commercial fishing industry.

My Name is William Dokai and I am an undergraduate fisheries biology student. I am writing today to urge that the current EPA respect years of scientific review that found that the risk posed by a potential mining project in the Pebble deposit was too great to risk. There is currently no evidence to support the claim that a mine here can be created and operated without causing severe, perhaps even devastating, and long lasting negative effects to the salmon, and water quality of the Bristol Bay watershed. Bristol Bay is a unique location, home to nearly half of the global abundance of sockeye salmon on the planet. It is simply irreplaceable as a natural resource, and a biological wonder. As such, the Bristol Bay area is far too important to risk by allowing a mining project to go forward. I strongly and wholeheartedly oppose the withdrawal of clean water protection for Bristol bay. It is simply too risky to create mine waste, which would last and remain potent for hundreds of years, upstream and uphill from the world's most productive salmon habitat. The mining waste would need to be contained, and mine drainage mitigated in perpetuity all in a seismically active, and remote wilderness, for hundreds of years. There is simply no precedent suggesting this can be done, and as such, a mine here is absolutely too much of a liability to allow. Please respect the years of scientific review that concluded that Bristol Bay deserves Clean Water Act protection.

Thank you for your time,
William Dokai",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

To do damage to that region is to damage the entire ecosystem. Short-term gains cannot win out over one of the last wild places in our great country.

For thousands of years, supporting the long term health of communities, this area has been and continues to be a rich natural resource for fish and wildlife, including one of the richest salmon spawning grounds in the world. This proposal will remove the Proposed Determination of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10 Pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska (July 2014), which would have served to protect this watershed from exploitation and destructive practices; while, the Pebble Limited Partnership, seeking private profit in a relatively short term, tells us that the area is depressed and people need jobs. This, they tell us, even though the jobs will be gone when the boom is over and the lands and waters fouled forever. 

The associated earthen dam alone, which will be expected to hold toxic sludge and tailings byproducts from the copper sulfide mining, into perpetuity, could not stand the test of time in this ecologically fragile area located in an earthquake zone. In addition, repercussions from an onslaught of torrential rains and weather conditions over time associated with a changing climate can be guaranteed. A failed dam would be tragic enough, but this does not preclude ongoing degradation during construction, operation and maintenance from blasting, transportation corridors, dewatering, dispersal of contaminants into the watershed, noise pollution and air pollution in the midst of a pristine invaluable natural environment. Fifteen years of research and study into a copper sulfide mine's possible effects in this sensitive area have only made the proposed mine more toxic.

Copper-sulfide mining in the Bristol Bay watershed would be devastating on our fresh water resources, the health of communities who depend on this watershed, the flora, fauna, unspoiled lakes, like Lake Iliamna, the long term profitability and viability of world class salmon and sports fishing, tourism and natural habitats. As if these things were not enough, how does monetary profit compare to true wealth? Do we choose short term boom and bust economies over the health of our planet? What is true wealth but an environment like that in the Bristol Bay watershed; and who in their right mind would give this up for any amount of financial gain? This watershed would be changed forever by permitting any copper sulfide mine to operate within its boundaries. 

I formally and respectfully request that the proposal herewith to withdraw proposed 404(c) protections for the Bristol Bay area be denied. The withdrawal legalese found under the name ""Proposed Determination to Restrict Use of Area as Disposal Site: Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska; Proposed Withdrawal"" will allow the permitting process for this mine to begin, an outcome that we cannot sanction for the sake of future generations who depend upon decisions we make today.

If you were in contact with the people who live there, if you would just speak to them and listen, you would know. If you've ever watched the sunset on the snow-covered mountains, or eaten a dungeness crab just caught and boiled on the beach, you would know it is imperative to leave this slice of paradise alone. No amount of money can replace this precious place, and once you allow it to be developed, it will be gone forever. How dare you think your decisions for wealth in the here and now should supersede an entire culture, and such a wildly intact ecosystem. The hubris is breathtaking.

I am opposed to EPAs proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

the environment, the water shed, the ocean, the salmon. I only see this as being in the best interest of the mining company and 
your own personal interests and those of your friends. After a private meeting with the Pebble mining executive you 
sign this order. Talk about a backdoor backroom deal. The only interest you have is to open as much land to mining and fossil 
fuel extraction as possible. With absolutely no regard to the environment or climate. Your actions are on behalf of the fossil fuel

brought to the surface and dumped in the watershed are a benefit to the environment. Explain how molybdenum , which exposure can cause 
severe health issues and even death.Is a benefit.  Living next to a molybdenum plant I saw the devastating health effects it had on cattle. That were exposed
to it by drinking contaminated water. Then eating hay from contaminated fields. Waiting to hear how this is a benefit to the 
environment or to the citizens of this country. Explain how the profits of Pebble benefit the environment or enhance national security
They don't. You have total disregard for the Native American community which considering who you are this isn't surprising. 
The impact on the fishing industry as a whole will be devastating. The salmon as a whole will be wiped out. Your total disregard for the scientific

Bristol Bay should continue to be protected and Scott Pruitt's attempt to allow for a mine the size of Manhattan and the depth of the Grand Canyon to be built in the last wild and unadulterated salmon run left in the world is wrong. Not only is it wrong but it is in DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE EPA'S MISSION to protect and restore the environment for current and future generations based on scientifically sound data. 

Bristol Bay is some of the last remaining pristine wildlands of our country, as well as an economic powerhouse supporting tens of thousands of jobs. In 2010 the Bristol Bay Regional Seafood Development Association executive summary demonstrated the creation of $1.5 billion in output and sales values that was felt across the whole of the United States. While the Pebble Mine would have economic benefits, they would be brief in comparison to the sustainability of the salmon industry in Bristol Bay. We have a country littered with closed mines that continue pollute our lands and harm our communities. Let us not be so short-sighted but learn the lessons our past has to teach us about stewardship of land and its' resources.

Please, DO NOT REVERSE the decision to protect Bristol Bay!

The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

that depend on tourism would be horrific. No one has a right to exploit this magnificent wilderness for money. The EPA must take a stand and put common sense first and 
reject this proposal. The sensitive wildlife and the loss of their habitat  has consequences that go far beyond today. As a country we must ensure that our natural resources aren't polluted for mere money !
I feel that the EPA must place a value on maintaining our countries natural resources and not dropping their core values by allowing this to happen.

Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.

Your position is supposed to be serving ALL Americans, NOT just the rich oil barons who already have enough money. :You have continual meetings with these people all the time and rarely meet with environmental groups.

I am concerned about the proposed withdrawal of the protections in place at the Pebble Deposit Area, and I urge you to keep the protections in place. I was born and raised in Homer, Alaska and grew up taking the Bristol Bay salmon fishery for granted. Practically every family I knew fished there commercially for sockeye salmon that fed the world -- it is the livelihood of our community and so many others in Alaska. My friends who grew up working on their family's commercial boats learned discipline and hard work and could see an economic future for themselves from an early age. It's a rare gift to be able to provide that for a kid growing up in our country today. Even though some of them may not have felt that college was their path, through that hard work and dedication and love of the fishing industry, they can thrive as lifelong fishermen. How many industries in our country can say the same? In a world where technology accelerates so much faster than many people can keep up with, the Bristol Bay salmon fishery is a constant for so many of us. 

I never considered that all this could one day be in jeopardy. It has been proven over and over that Pebble Mine poses an enormous risk to the Bristol Bay watershed, no matter which way you look at it. Not only is the Bristol Bay salmon fishery an incredible and sustainable economic powerhouse of our state, it also provides so many of those things that can't be measured -- a sense of place and belonging, truly sustainable vocational work, economic independence for those who depend on it, a connection to our food, an opportunity for kids to grow up knowing how to work hard, environmental stewardship. These are things that the Pebble Mine can never give Alaska, and the Pebble Mine will not last forever. The Bristol Bay watershed, which can last forever if we protect it, should be allowed to do so. Please make the right decision and protect this area.

Sincerely,
Emily Kizzia",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

This will harm people!  This is not America First!

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.

Large scale mining operations should not be located in the sensitive and unique ecosystems of Bristol Bay.  The Proposed Determination is a clear case for using Section 404(c) to give an advanced decision to preclude unacceptable impacts.
 The EPA conducted a thorough, multiyear scientific investigation of the Bristol Bay Watershed and potential impacts from the mining proposals.  EPA concluded that mining operations would cause unacceptable adverse effects on fish and animal habitats in the Bristol Bay Watershed.  The magnitude of the projected environmental impacts are well documented in EPA's peer reviewed report, and these losses will be irreversible. Impacts to sockeye salmon will be extreme.  Anyone who has followed the loss of salmon in Europe, followed by losses in North America's Atlantic Ocean, and finally the losses and continuing impacts to salmon in the Pacific Ocean and its watersheds in the western United States and Canada should recognize that our opportunities to sustain salmon are rapidly disappearing.  Failure to learn from our past mistakes by allowing more impacts to salmon from proposed mining is both ignorant and unforgivable.
EPA should move forward on this PD because it already followed an extensive public process on this matter, and it is a waste of government resources to ignore the existing scientific work and its conclusions and to begin a new project review process.  EPA provided opportunities for public comment on two draft scientific assessments.  The EPA followed the Clean Water Act and its procedures.  In fact, EPA went above and beyond the required procedures and offered two draft reports for public comment prior to publishing its final assessment. No information or evidence as to why the existing scientific assessment is flawed has been presented. The process to date - with EPA's publication of the Final Bristol Bay Assessment in January 2014 -- was a fair process and compliant with the Clean Water Act. The existing EPA assessment is a thorough and legitimate basis for moving forward with the Clean Water Act 404(c) protections.

This proposal to allow a mine to operate in Bristol Bay Alaska is a terrible and irresponsible idea.  Bristol Bay is home to one of the last great intact ecosystems on the planet supporting one of the few remaining wild salmon runs.  It is a crime against nature to allow a Canadian mining company to come in and destroy this ecosystem.

To Whom It May Concern:

I am utterly dismayed at having to write EPA yet again in regards to the extremely thorough, extensively peer reviewed Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment and resulting Proposed Determination to limit discharge of dredged or fill material in the Bristol Bay watershed.  I am a freshwater ecologist who has conducted research on the proposed Pebble site for a decade where I collect and analyze data regarding physical habitat, water chemistry, primary producers (diatoms including algae), aquatic insects, and fish.  Our dataindeed ALL relevant data meticulously reviewed by EPA under the previous administrationclearly indicate, beyond doubt, that even the smallest mine described by Pebble proponents simply can NOT be built without harm to salmon and the habitat upon which they rely.

I am writing to request that you finalize the Proposed Determination once and for all, and limit discharge of dredged of filled material as described within.

When I started work on the Pebble site in 2009, I was legitimately unbiased and frankly rather ignorant of the factors related to mining that could put the salmon fishery at risk.  Within the first few days of walking on the siteand nearly sinking to my thighs in the wet, swampy tundraI began to understand the magnitude of subsurface water flow in the region.  It is a giant sponge.  And those characteristics are what will make containment of waste to any one watershed absolutely impossible.  As time went on, I also learned more about the chemistry of the area.  Unfortunately, what so perfectly fosters salmon spawning and rearing also makes waters extremely sensitive to chemical changes resulting from copper-porphyry mining.  The waters lack the ability to buffer acid inevitably generated by all porphyry mining activity.  Waters also lack organic constituents to reduce the toxicity of metals that will be leached by acid if mining occurs.  Consequently, Pebble, or any other large scale mining activity in the area will undoubtedly produce an acidic, toxins-laden environment.  We have learned the hard way in so many other parts of the world that salmon are extremely sensitive to toxins like copper.  At increases of just 2-10 parts per billion of copper (often within legally allowable discharge limits), salmon lose their ability to smell.  Smell is absolutely essential to a salmon's ability to detect prey and mates, and to navigate back to their natal habitat to spawna behavior which has evolved over millennia and is the key to maintaining the genetic and environmental structure necessary for population persistence.  

These risks include only the most basic, lowest level impacts of mine operation itself.  In addition to mine workings, development will require road building and increased access to the area, energy generation, and a deepwater port.  All told, these industrial activities amount to exactly the kinds of habitat degradation that salmon ecologists all agree were responsible for the demise first of Atlantic salmon runs in Europe and the east coast of North America, and then for Pacific salmon of the West Coast.  We have come too far in our understanding both of salmon ecology and population loss globally, and of the specifics of mining in Bristol Bay to discard the work of dozens, if not hundreds, of people over an accumulation of more than a decade.

The science speaks for itself.  While it seems this administration tends to discredit and/or ignore science, it is also important to consider the economics of this project.  As you know, the Bristol Bay commercial salmon fishery alone supports upwards of 14,000mostly AMERICANjobs.  These are jobs that could last centuries into the future given the world-class management of this fishery.  Those jobs are ALL at risk in light of potential mining activities.  And mining jobs would be much fewer and highly specialized, last only decades, and in all likelihood be outsourced to Canadians in many cases, given Canadian ownership of the mine claims.  Given this administration touts their support for American jobsa sentiment which I supportdevelopment of Pebble Mine flies in the face of basic economic arguments.

For these reasons and many, many more, I urge you once again to please provide certainty to the people of the Bristol Bay region, and to those of us globally who depend on the last great runs of wild sockeye salmon, and finalize the Proposed Determination to limit discharge of dredged and filled material.

Thank you kindly for your consideration.

Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Stop attacking our environment.  You are supposed to protect it and preserve what we have.  This is just a terrible, harmful idea.


Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

the sockeye salmon spawning grounds in Bristol Bay, Alaska protected by the EPA. The thing is, you don't have a deep 
understanding of what is going on there. Almost half of the world's salmon comes from that one spawning ground. And The 
Pebble Mining Company wants to destroy that spawning ground for copper and gold. Even though they think they can mine that 
area safely and not harm the salmon, the way we mine now is blowing up the land. You would think that would be good, but in 
the process heavy metals like mercury, arsenic, and uranium are dispersed into the water because mining companies think that 
the world is a giant trash can for the garbage they blow up. The thing is, is that that trash can is full and nowhere else to put the 
garbage (by the way, there is no space garbage truck). They think they can litter into the salmon populated waters of that bay. 
That would be REALLY bad if you think about it. About half of the world's salmon gone because The Pebble Mining Company 
want nothing else but money and commerce. The sockeye salmon of that area are beautiful fish and do not deserve to go from

What on God's Earth are you thinking??! Mining in that area risks so very much and could destroy a valuable fishing economy and utterly destroy a pristine ecological area.

I was born in Alaska; that place is special to me and to countless Americans. It is not a treasure-house for mining companies and others to pillage.

I urge you to stand with American jobs and the local Alaskan communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

The proposed mine's infrastructure and waste would have significant and negative impacts on the ecosystems we thrive on.  Many miles of the surrounding rivers would be rendered uninhabitable, and many fish populations would be destroyed.

While mining the mineral and ore in this region can be valuable, it is not nearly as valuable as the communities and ecosystems this open pit mine may destroy.  The mine that Pebble Limited Partnership is proposing has a negative net present value when taking into account all of the impacts (community, environment, economic, etc.) the mine will have, and is a poor alternative to the current economies that are in this region.

It is possible for mines to operate with minimal environmental impact and still boost the local economy, however the removal of the restrictions on the use of the rivers for dredge and fill is in every way contradictory to conscientious, minimally invasive projects.  Additionally, it is extremely difficult to mitigate the accidental spill of such material in the Pebble area due to the surrounding terrain and conditions.  Indeed, the Pebble Mine executives claim that such mines can be environmentally friendly and work with local fishing populations, such as the Red Dog Mine.  However, the Red Dog Mine released over one billion pounds of toxic chemicals in 2014 alone, making it the largest polluter in the United States at the time.

It is with great sincerity that I ask you to keep the restrictions proposed in the 2014 Proposed determination and not proceed with the 2017 settlement to remove those restrictions.  Pebble Limited Partnership should have to work with these restrictions and respect the surrounding environment.

For decades, my family members have relied on the health and sustainability of Alaska's regulated fisheries. It is very clear the impact a project like the Pebble Mine would have on this unique and powerful environmental resource--there is absolutely no way to deny the impact to local fisheries, fishing communities, native lands and the plants and animals that thrive and rely on Bristol Bay. Bristol Bay is known around the world as a pristine, highly regulated fishery, one of the rare, truly sustainable fisheries that continues to give each season--to feed us, to support us financially, and to enrich our ecosystems. 

The Environmental Protection Agency has it's name for a reason. It is there to protect our environment and the resources that come from our planet. The function of the EPA is not to open doors to massive corporations to develop projects that future generations will need to continuously monitor for decades to come in order to avoid environmental disaster. The function of the EPA is to be grounded in science, not in proposed profits or corporate lobbyists. The EPA can do some of the most critical work in our nation by protecting our water sources. As the EPA, and an American citizen and active voter, I expect you do to do. Recent developments have made us citizens wonder who the EPA is protecting. Removing the protections offered by the the previous administration's EPA (wise as they were) in Bristol Bay is alarming. I do not support the removal of protections the EPA placed in Bristol Bay in 2014. Any advancement of this project is a direct attack on the safety, health, and well-being of American citizens and the environment we all rely on.

This comment is in regard to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. I support OPPOSING waste disposal into Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. If Pebble Mine is supported by the EPA, it could become a detrimental long-term risk to sustainability in the area and the economic significance of the fishery that depends on the area fish. A full 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value, valued at $165 million for 29 healthy salmon, came from Bristol Bay alone. It is an economic powerhouse and in need of vital economic protection.

Wild salmon is proven to be healthier than farmed salmon. Bristol Bay is obviously a huge provider of nutritious wild salmon. The environment of Bristol Bay and the economic profit it provides should not be devastated in favor of the Pebble Mine. I am asking the EPA to immediately OPPOSE the Pebble Mine and instead support existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to preserve this invaluable wild salmon fishery.

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

Not only is it a risk to the fisheries, however, but also to public health and safety. Run off from copper mines often contains sulfuric compounds, which usually safely covered by dirt, react with air to form sufuric acid, causing acid drainage. Not only this, but heavy metals, such as copper, found in run off commonly build up in the fatty tissues of forementioned salmon, and, with high enough concentrations, makes these fish dangerous for people to consume, accutely so in the case of pregnant women as will as children. As many families in the area rely upon the  reliability of the wild salmon in the area, you can understand why this is particularly concerning.

By the EPA's own assessment, up to 91 miles of streams and 4,900 acres of wetland, which support 3 Federal Wildlife preserves, may be lost in the event of failure. I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable watershed, as such a development is a plea for disaster. Irreplaceable as it is to the state, ecosystem, and people of Alaska, I feel that it is best not to tempt fate, for as long as Murphy's Law applies.

With hopes for both the present and the future,

The Bristol Bay fisheries are one of the few in the world that combine all three objectives. If we undervalue the Land and waters that supply our food, we will jeapordize our food security for the future. Instead of opening Bristol Bay up for mining, send a message that the EPA recognizes the value of Sustainable fisheries, and use this media attention to reward business done right.

Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.

I am deeply concerned about the recent trends of the EPA toward reducing environmental protections without adequate scientific reasoning or evidence. I am writing as an environmental scientist and geologist with formal training and scientific  knowledge in these topics. I live in a small city which is hydrologically downstream of several abandoned copper and gold mines, including the superfund site Iron Mountain Mine. The environmental impact of these sites, including their waste disposal areas, is significant and cannot be ignored. They have cost US taxpayers tens of millions of dollars to clean up and cleanup is still a work in progress. They have negatively impacted ground- and surface- waters. They have negatively impacted air quality. And while at one time they provided an economic boom to the area, they now continue to cost us, the citizens, millions. 

I ask  that you maintain the Clean Water Act as it was written and honor its intention. Protect the vital economy generated by the salmon industry in the area of the proposed project. Do not approve mining operations or disposal sites in the Pebble Deposit Area of Southwest Alaska. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

To do so would be an egregious example of short sightedness - sacrificing natural beauty and recreational opportunities that have been in existence for thousands of years to enable profiteering from resources that don't actually seem to even be in short supply.  They just offer a chance to make someone some money today.  I first went fishing in Katmai National Park eight years ago, finally fulfilling one of my bucket list items with a once in a lifetime opportunity to experience the beauty of this land firsthand.  I have just completed my eighth such once-in-a-lifetime trips - as the call of this remote and beautiful landscape is irresistible.  Once destroyed, it can never be replaced.  Yet the mining opportunity will be there forever.  Preferably this land will always remain in its current condition, but if for some reason we actually NEED the resources there why not wait - 50 or even 100 years, when no doubt the innovative miners will have found much better and environmentally friendly ways to extract them?  Again - this mine is a solution in search of a problem - there is no need for this mine at this time, if ever.  I implore you not to destroy one of the most beautiful places in America, if not on the planet, in favor of nominal profiteering.  To do so would surely change this natural wonder from ""Seward's Folly"" to ""Pruitt's and Trump's Folly.

Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.
As head of the Environmental Protection Agency, don't you feel the need to protect the environment?  Now that you have this high responcebility isn't the health and safety of the biosphere and all living beings more important than fossil fuel interests in Oklahoma? 

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Salmon are the very definition of a keystone species responsible for the movement of nutrients from the ocean into the upper elevations. No pit mine has ever been safe or clean, period. I grew up in Arizona surrounded by open pit copper mines that devastated our landscape, poisoned our streams, and eliminated the traditional practices of Native Americans (access to which is legally obligated under international law). These pit mines in Arizona are so hated that one of the largest groups opposing any new mine development is a coalition of retired mine workers who do not wish for their children or anyone's children to work in the conditions that they did. We have lost so much to mining in the west and many other countries (Australia, New Guinea, Chile) continue to lose their natural places. This is why our country set itself apart by forming the EPA. It is moments like this, when the greed of a few threaten the simple lives and sacred places of many, for which this department was founded. Please do what is right and deny the Pebble Mine their permit. The scientists have already submitted their work over the past three years. There is no ambiguity here. Pebble Mine would do irreparable damage to the most valuable fishery in the world. As a citizen of the Northwest (Spokane, WA) I know the value of wild salmon to the overall ecosystem. We cannot allow Alaska to lose the fish runs that we once had here in Washington and Idaho.

God bless America, let's try to save some of it.

I ask that you do not approve Pebble Limited Partnership's application to mine metals and minerals in Bristol Bay. As a citizen, professional, and mother concerned about the health and future of our nation, I vote in every election--local and national--and reach out to my elected officials frequently. It is out of concern for the U.S. environment and economy that I state my strong opposition to the project, for the following reasons:

1.	The mining would cause harm to the aquatic environment by introducing foreign contaminants. 
2.	Chemical contaminants and mechanical processes would be disastrous to the health of native species, specifically the sockeye salmon beloved by American consumers. Further, through the process of biomagnification, any chemicals consumed by the fish would then be ingested by humans, whose health would be jeopardized. 
3.	Approving the project would be anti-business. Salmon harvests in the Bristol Bay region produce upwards of 200 millions dollars in revenue. Allowing open-pit mining, or mining of any kind, in this region would deal a serious blow to the U.S.'s GDP. 
4.	Allowing any additional pollution of American waters, waters that were pristine at the dawn of this wondrous nation just a few short centuries ago, would be a direct threat to the continued growth of this nation and the immediate health of those living and working in the bay or consuming its products.

I appreciate your careful consideration of this comment, one that represents the voices of so many other friends, family, and colleagues who are firmly against the approval of the Pebble Limited Partnership project. I ask that you consider the health of U.S. citizens, the environment, and the economy in making this decision. It is one in which you can be pro-business (the multi-million dollar sockeye business in Bristol Bay) and pro-health simultaneously, and the right move for this country.

The establishment of the Pebble Mine would have disastrous economic, social and ecological effects.

The sustainable salmon industry provides thousands of jobs every year to local communities in the Bristol Bay area.  As the sockeye salmon population would be destroyed by the mine, these jobs would also disappear.

The cultural importance of the fishing industry for all members of the Bristol Bay community should not be downplayed.  For the Native American population, the lifecycle of the salmon has been an intrinsic part of their culture for generations.  There have been articles as recently as December, 2016 in the Journal of Marine and Island Cultures advocating for the importance of fishing in giving communities sense of place and value for their home.  The Pebble Mine would jeopardize those communities.  

The ecological consequences of the Pebble Mine grossly outweigh any potential advantages.  Bristol Bay is home to 56 million sockeye salmon, nearly half the world's population.  As a keystone species, 137 other species depend on the salmon for survival.  This includes other fish, reptiles, and birds including the American bald eagle.  Beyond the direct danger for the salmon, the effects of a mine in a gravel bay like Bristol Bay are unthinkable.  It would be impossible to contain water contamination that could lead to health and safety risks for millions of people. 

I ask you to think about what's at stake in this decision.  Protecting the environment is literally your job.

There is absolutely no way the proposed Pebble Mine should even be considered, let alone be approved. I find the relaxation of the Sockeye fishery protections to be disturbing, and I find the possibility of an open pit mine (no matter what the size) in this area to be obscene.

Proponents argue that the mine is 100 miles away and the nearby tributaries feed only 1% of the total watershed. If there are no concerns here, then why did the Sockyeye fishery protections go away?

As a Montanan who has seen first-hand reclamation disasters of open pit gold mines (Berkeley Pit Superfund Site), and the cost to the taxpayer (Arco Superfund Site, Pony) for reclamation, this proposal is the classic; greed over common good scenario. 

Anyone with a shred of stewardship in their value system would completely reject the Pebble Mine out-of-hand. I wonder how many people are aware of the thousands of Snow Geese that have been killed just by landing in the Berkeley Pit over the years? A mine that was shut down decades ago.

I hope that clear heads will prevail and this proposal be rejected for what it is; powerful, wealthy interests getting special treatment in the form of relaxed regulations, and flat-out corporate greed. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Thanks for taking the time to review and consider my comments. I will keep this short as I see the large amounts of comments inbound for you to review.

In light of the Settlement Agreement, I firmly believe that the EPA should allow permitting on the Pebble mine to be initiated and for the proposed determination to be based off of the permit application. This enforces my view that the legal and regulatory pathways to development must be respected and adhered to, further the rule of law and equity should be honoured.

Northern Dynasty Minerals deserves the opportunity to rightfully engage all stakeholders and submit a permit application of which future EPA consideration and review should then be based off of. 

I, too, am concerned about our environment but also see a preemptive determination to set a dangerous and imbalanced precedent.

Cleanup, should any such adverse effect transpire, would be impossible and immediately deemed NOT economically viable.  So, too, would the region, equipment, and facilities be abandoned and/or permanently scarred should the price of the minerals plummet.

Bristol Bay exhibits unparalleled ecological values.  Disposals, fill, sediment, and toxic chemicals kill salmon. Native salmon populations along the eastern Pacific are at risk and this is one of the most productive salmon populations existing.  Over 14,000 people depend on these salmon for their jobs.  Native tribes depend on subsistence lifestyles with salmon as a critical component of their diet and culture.  It is unfathomable that a Federal Government agency such as the EPA is even thinking about disregarding the recommendations of staff and scientists to accommodate the demands of industry over the future of our planet. 

In my lifetime I have witness the demise of salmon.  Little by little, whether it be land use decisions (development), dumping, overfishing, poorly managed forests, dams and water diversion, climate change or other impacts, we are now witnessing population declines in species dependent on salmon, such as the Southern Resident pods of Orcas.  Juvenile Orcas in these pods are dying prematurely due to malnutrition. Salmon is the staple of their diet.

This is the last place on Earth where an intact ecosystem exists to support culturally, economically, and ecologically critical wild salmon populations. Its destruction is not worth the trade off for more copper and gold on cultural, economic and ecological grounds. There is no way to balance the benefits of developing the mine with its risks and costs. This resource and the ecosystem that supports it is the backbone of Southwest Alaska and the future of wild salmon populations. This designation was determined during a rigorous peer-reviewed scientific process that took place over many years, not to mention the 80 years of fishery data and ecosystem data and analysis to back it up on Bristol Bay's salmon populations. This reeks of yet another example of big mining companies getting their way through their disproportionate influence on politicians and government agencies over the will of the people most dependent on such a resource, and the good sense of science. Has Scott Pruitt seen a map of all recorded earthquakes in Alaska with the location of the proposed Pebble Mine also indicated on the map? This risk by itself (one of many) indicates that a person has to be either crazy, completely blinded by greed, or utterly ignorant to the risks of such a mine to convince themselves that placing a mine of this size and type in this region can be done with no harm to the ecosystem. Its not worth the trade off and in the long run (as in, perpetuity) this mine will cost the people of Alaska, and of the USA, and of the World, the value of gold and copper stored at this site many many times over its value.

Mail Code 28221T

Attention: Docket ID No. EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369

Dear EPA:

The bottom-line, with regards to EPA's Clean Water Act authority, is to internalize potential environmental externalities that might occur with any development that requires a Section 404 permit so that these costs (including opportunity costs due to limitations imposed on project development) are borne by the project developer rather than public resources and/or users of those resources.  Adding these costs (which should be considered the actual price of doing business) to a proposed project might make it less attractive economically or even unfeasible, but that choice is the developers as long as EPA does it job and clearly lays out, based on accepted scientific and economic analysis, the boundary between internal and external costs and avoids being hamstrung by politics, which often attempts to blur these boundaries.  If EPA gets too involved in the politics, it risks picking winners and losers, which is not its role. The complexity of this analysis depends on the scale of the project and its potential for damaging public resources and externalizing these diseconomies to the public.  In the case of the proposed Pebble Mine, or any other large mine in the Bristol Bay watershed, a rigorous approach is essential to a legitimate permitting process which serves both the public and responsible project developers and gives needed protection to one of the world's most valuable and sustainable fisheries.

Living in Homer, Alaska, where I can literally see where some of the infrastructure for the proposed Pebble Mine would be, I have followed this issue over its years of claims, counterclaims, and obfuscations. The one strong impression I have is that the EPA has done things right in its review of the proposed project, despite the moving target presented by its sponsors of what the project entails.  The EPA has been methodical in its analysis, thorough in its review, and fair in its public process.  In doing so, it has provided the guidance that industry usually asks for; stating at an early stage of project development the conditions that the project needs to abide by.  This certainty reduces wasted effort in project design and permitting and, in the rare case where a proposed project has fatal flaws, informs project sponsors of the risk it might be taking in proceeding with the project.  It also provides some stability to the permitting process, another condition that industry usually insists on.

In the action recently proposed by EPA to withdraw the Proposed Determination for Bristol Bay, it is not clear to me what EPA expects to accomplish consistent with EPA's mandate embodied in the Clean Water Act.  It appears to be backing away from having done the right thing with respect to the permitting process for any large-scale open-pit mine in the Bristol Bay watershed.  While revisiting previous decisions may serve the Pebble Partnership in its Quixote quest to obtain permits for their proposed mine, it injects uncertainty into the entire Section 404 permitting process as well as undermines agency confidence as perceived by many Alaskan stakeholders who also seek some kind of permitting stability.  

It appears to me that the withdrawal of the Proposed Determination is displacing an emphasis on science as the basis for decision-making with an emphasis on legal interpretation that might result in a different decision.  This concerns me.  When the intent of the law and the consensus of science don't match, the law needs to be changed, not the science.  The reason is that although the legal process is rigorous, laws themselves are ephemeral.  In essence, if you have the votes, a law (hence court decisions) can be dramatically changed overnight.  On the other hand, unlike court decisions which are based on deciding a winner and loser and often influenced by legal technicalities rather than substantive fact, science is based on reaching consensus among peers, which takes a long time to accomplish and thereby is not ephemeral.  Since this notice to withdraw is still a proposal, I strongly suggest that if any changes are made, then the law needs to be changed to match and support what is currently accepted science.   

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this issue.  The integrity of how this proposed withdrawal is handled has major consequences for many Alaskans, as we have seen from previous public process.  

Sincerely,
George Matz

We have one planet that provides us with tremendous resources wheather it's life itself, the trees and the water, or the copper and gold buried in the ground. Some of these resources are finite while others are not. To access some of these resources, which have economic importance, we have to destroy other resources. However, we can limit our destruction of other resources by realizing the impacts we are having and  mitigate the impacts. By allowing for pebble mine to have greater access to the resources it seeks, copper, gold, and molybdenum, we are allowing a greater destruction of resources that we need for basic life, food, water, and shelter. The impacts that a mine like pebble could have on salmon, fish and other marine life is huge and that's just the food side of the argument. Clean water which we all need will be  jeopardized  and trees and plants will also feel the brunt of a mine like pebble. Take a look at the Mount Polley disaster, a copper and gold mine in northern British Columbia, where dams holding tailings failed and 10 million cubic meters of toxic tailings water was released effecting the surrounding areas and evening having an impact on Fraser river, which provides homes to salmon, grizzly bears and other wildlife. In  addition, effecting the economy and people's livelihoods. 

I understand that  copper and gold provide myself and our economy things we couldn't even imagine, e.g. an IPhone. However at what cost. As a citizen of this great nation, for me please ask yourself this and do not allow for the pebble mine to continue to be developed. 

Sincerely,

I strongly object to the proposed withdrawal of your own agency's July 2014 Clean Water Act 404(d) determination to restrict the use of certain waters as disposal sites for dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit in the Bristol Bay Watershed.

Instead of withdrawing this determination, I ask that the EPA use your authority to PREVENT CONTAMINATION of waters and wetlands supporting the amazingly prolific and sustainable Bristol Bay salmon fisheries by using the EPA's authority to limit contamination of waters.  

If you withdraw this determination, you are taking one step towards approving a project with environmental impacts to the Bristol Bay fisheries that cannot be mitigated. Mitigation projects in other parts of the Pacific Northwest have not been successful in maintaining sustainable fisheries. 

The Bristol Bay fishery should be maintained for natural ecosystem diversity. But do you also know that the fishery is valued at up to $1.5 billion USD back in 2010?

Again, I ask you to stop the withdrawal of the 404(d) determination and do not allow any mining project in the Bristol Bay watershed to impair waters. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

The should not be given that opportunity.  Stick with the original degree.  Mining in that pristine area is not wanted.  More than 80 percent of local residents and 62 percent statewide oppose the project.  Don't forget the ballot initiative that passed in 2014, requiring any mining development that affects the salmon fishing industry in Bristol Bay to seek approval from the State Legislature.  The people of Alaska know mining there would destroy or severely impact the coho salmon fishing industry and the attendant tourism industry.  And this is no way to treat indigenous peoples.  Indigenous people have subsisted on wild salmon in Bristol Bay for 4,000 years.

 This is the most valuable salmon fishery in the world and the habitat there for salmon that makes it such a productive salmon place is that it is basically a giant gravel bed. That means it's almost impossible to contain water that leaches into it.  There is no way a company could or should store highly toxic waste (from a mine) behind a dam there. It would leach into the bay in a heartbeat.  Any geologist can tell you that.

The EPA's 2014 assessment says the mine would employ more than 1,000 people during its lifespan, and more than 2,000 people during the shorter construction phase. The mine would be expected to create $300 billion to $500 billion in revenue over the life of the project, the EPA estimated. Revenue for whom?  The Canadian company who owns it?  Not good enough!!

Only fools would risk the, ""World's Most Productive Fishery,"" by locating a Earthen Dam filled with toxins upstream .

Climatologist models suggest that Alaska is in for a lot more rain. 

Ask the residents along the Frazier River in British Columbia about the Polley Creek Dam Disaster on August 4, 2014.

A Dam Breach like this could very well occur again and this time destroy the Bristol Bay Watershed forever.

As a lifelong Alaskan, I know the importance of salmon. Salmon is integral to our way of life, both culturally and economically. I have many friends and family who have worked in the Bristol Bay fishery, on boats and in the canneries. I have eaten salmon from Bristol Bay for my entire life. I am extremely concerned that building a mine in Bristol Bay would threaten this pristine resource and the communities which rely on this resource. The proposed mine, even the smaller project, envisions construction of a large-scale development which would undoubtedly have detrimental impacts in the untouched environment. The proposed project would have a heavily polluted tailings pond which is proposed to exist ""indefinitely."" I am extremely concerned about the potential for such a tailings pond to fail at some point in time, which would have catastrophic effect on salmon and salmon habitat. The salmon run in Bristol Bay has existed for thousands of years and is one of the healthiest salmon runs in the world. I ask the EPA to continue to protect this resource and to not withdraw the July 2014 Proposed Determination.

Re: Docket ID No. EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369

Dear Administrator Pruitt:

We the undersigned group of 16 ecologists and fisheries biologists have joined together as a working group to research the state of Alaskan salmon, and particularly how evidence-based decision making and clean water impact salmon populations and the people who depend on them. We submit this letter in response to the proposal to withdraw the EPA's July 2014 Clean Water Act 404(c) Proposed Determination to restrict the development of mining activities within the Pebble deposit in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. We oppose this withdrawal on account of the substantial weight and clarity of the science reported by the EPA showing that the risks of mining in this region would lead to negative consequences to water quality, habitat for a range of species, and salmon fisheries that cannot be adequately reduced or mitigated. The Bristol Bay watershed remains one of the last intact and fully functioning wild salmon ecosystems on Earth, where last year alone over 50 million adult sockeye salmon returned, of which 37.7 million were sustainably harvested for a commercial value of $209.9 million dollars. The ability of the watershed to consistently produced salmon is directly the result of clean, cold, complex, and connected habitats which scale mining would impair. Therefore, we recommend that the EPA use its authority under section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act to preemptively prevent elimination and impairment of streams supporting the wildlife of Bristol Bay and its salmon fisheries.

As you reconsider the Clean Water 404(c) determination, we urge you to consider the EPA report entitled ""An Assessment of Potential Mining Impacts on Salmon Ecosystems of Bristol Bay, Alaska"". In this report, the EPA conducted a comprehensive review incorporating the best available science. This report presents an important resource to inform policy-makers of the costs, benefits, and risks of the proposed mining activities in Bristol Bay.

And beginning this year, 2017, my Forever Wild Seafood business will market Bristol Bay Salmon Jerky under the Forever Wild brand, www.foreverwildseafood.com. 

My fishing and salmon marketing business rely upon the continued abundance of the Bristol Bay salmon fishery. My business success depends as well upon the reputation of Bristol Bay as untarnished by other resource extraction, especially that which requires habitat destruction and the substantial use of toxic substances that could be released into the Bristol Bay Watershed. 

Let us praise and protect the famous Bristol Bay, Alaska, USA, Fishery. This vibrant, sustainable Fishery is ALL-ALASKAN, ALL-AMERICAN. And it must be clearly noted that the company that proposes to open and operate a mine in Bristol Bay, the Pebble Partnership, is foreign-owned. If there was ever a chance to ""Put America First,"" it is by taking every legal permitting precaution, be it Local, State, Tribal, and Federal, to insure that no damage is done to this healthy Alaskan/American ecosystem.  

I support implementing the Proposed Determination of the US EPA Region 10 Pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska.  

In my following comment, I substantially reference EPA's documents, specifically the peer-reviewed Assessment of Potential Mining Impacts on Salmon Ecosystems of Bristol Bay, Alaska, 2014 and the Proposed Determination Executive Summary, 2014, both of which were subject to public comment, and both of which enjoyed a super-majority of approximately 70% support. I believe EPA has conducted a credible process of due diligence leading up to this Proposed Determination and submit that EPA's own reports provide the best information to support said Proposed Determination.

I support protecting the salmon fishery in Bristol Bay and the livelihood of Native Americans there who maintain a subsistence-based way of life.  Any mining development near Bristol Bay should be conducted in a manner that is consistent with Clean Water Act safeguards and that protects the ecology and recreational value of the area for all Americans.

I oppose withdrawal of the proposed Clean Water Act determination protecting the Bristol Bay watershed, for several reasons:

	The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world.  Withdrawing the determination would allow mining to proceed in a manner that - according to EPA's peer-reviewed assessment - could unacceptably harm fish habitat and fisheries in the Bristol Bay watershed.  This would jeopardize the livelihood of thousands of Alaskans.

	The watershed is home to 25 federally recognized tribal governments who have maintained a salmon-based culture and subsistence-based way of life for at least 4,000 years.

	A majority of Alaska voters oppose mining development that would harm wild salmon within the fisheries preserve, as evidenced by voter approval of the 2014 state-wide ballot measure.  The measure was designed to give the legislature the power to prohibit mining projects in Bristol Bay if legislators determine the activity to be harmful to wild salmon within the fisheries reserve. [Source: Alaska Bristol Bay Mining Ban, Ballot Measure 4, 2014. https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Bristol_Bay_Mining_Ban,_Ballot_Measure_4_(2014).]  Also, the overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the proposed Pebble Mine project.  (Source: United Tribes of Bristol Bay. Opposition to Pebble Mine Reiterated by local tribes, fishermen, business owners.http://utbb.org/opposition-to-pebble-mine-reiterated-by-local-tribes-fishermen-business-owners/)

	Thewatershed's ecological resources generated nearly $480 million in direct economic expenditures and sales and provided employment for over 14,000 full- and part-time workers in 2009. (Source: U.S. EPA. An Assessment of Potential Mining Impacts on Salmon Ecosystems of Bristol Bay, Alaska (Final Report). U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC, EPA 910-R-14-001A-C, ES, 2014. Chapter 5.)

	Contrary to comments by the backers of the Pebble Mine project, EPA's watershed assessment was scientifically based and thoroughly peer-reviewed, and the public has had an extensive opportunity to comment on it. The assessment and public comments received should be key components of any future action on this issue.

	The rationale for the proposed withdrawal is flawed. Finalizing the proposed determination would provide more regulatory certainty than withdrawing it, and a permit application is not needed to augment the factual record.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment.  A formatted version of these comments is submitted as an attached file.

Pebble's world class mine plan should be allowed to go through the lawful permitting process.

1) Pebble is ~100 miles from Bristol Bay. The media has been deceiving the public for years via photos and words to make some people falsely believe the proposed mine would be 'on the bay'.

2) There are no salmon streams within the proposed Pebble mine. It is a moonscape with <0.5% of Bristol Bay salmon streams within 400 sq miles. The media has been deceiving the public by stating Salmon would be threatened with 'devastation'. When in fact ~zero Salmon would be at risk. 

3) Pebble will:
-Not use cyanide
-have little contaminated waste rock
-clean to code and discharge all water (redundancy to avoid water spill if asteroid hits dam)
-store solid tailings that remain behind a wide/low dam that uses special lining and is 2x the strength needed to survive the worst possible Alaskan earthquake right at the site... even though there is no mega fault at the site.

Reality is, the worst case scenario, a dam failure, is virtually impossible. 

And if a failure did occur, the impact would be minor (<1/5000 Bristol Salmon impacted by sediments.) This is because there is redundant safety in the design. (i.e. clean & discharge waste water, separate tailings by chemical content, special linings, avoiding chemicals like cyanide, etc.)

The MSM and activist groups want us to remain ignorant of these and other facts so you will see a large 'manufactured opposition' to what in reality will be a leading example of super environmentally friendly copper mines.

I support a well regulated Federal and State permitting process for Pebble. Pebble's design plan should be given a fair chance to set the world standard and clear all requirements by a wide margin. 

Please uphold the law and uphold what is right for Alaskans and Americans. All Alaskans will benefit financially and Americans will take a leap towards regaining strategic mineral independence.

Please send a message that activists... colluding for years with the Obama EPA... to draft the 2011 proposed determination... based on false assumptions... is both unlawful and unethical.  

The corrupt former EPA officials knowingly subverted a lawful permitting process designed to ensure lawful environmental regulations for all new projects.  

Since 2011, Pebble has been red taped while Chinese mines and industry openly dump so many toxins that 750,000 Chiness die annually from water/air pollution. 

US MSM ignores that growing crisis, while Britain and others cover it in vain.

Please resolve this matter as fast as possible so this 6 year injustice can be decisively corrected. Please allow Pebble to follow the EPA's lawful permitting process.

Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.

This is a no-brainer; the present use is far more economically valuable to the Alaskans than a mine that will most probably be an ecological disaster for the area and leave after depleting the resource with Alaskans left holding the bag of junk.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Dear Administrator Pruitt, 

I am writing to ask you to uphold the EPA's 404c protection of Bristol Bay, Alaska and its thriving commercial fishing and seafood processing industries from large-scale mining activity. Bristol Bay is home to the world's largest wild sockeye salmon fishery, which produces nearly half of the world harvest of sockeye salmon, generates billions of dollars in economic output every year, and supports thousands of American jobs. Although I reside in Rhode Island, I have been working in Bristol Bay seasonally for the past thirteen years.

Due to the concerns over the proposed Pebble mine expressed by many Alaskans, the Environmental Protection Agency has already undertaken years of research on the effects of mining activity in the region, and released the Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment. Based on this assessment, which definitively shows that the risks of large-scale mining in Bristol Bay are significant, the EPA rightfully took preventative action against the potential devastation posed by a mine such as Pebble. Even without a disaster or major spill, large open-pit mines like Pebble would cause lasting damage to the fishery - destroying up to 94 miles of salmon-bearing streams and up to 5,300 acres of critical wetlands and salmon habitat.

After two sets of peer reviews and public comments that generated over a million responses, the final assessment served as a solid foundation for taking preemptive 404c action on the deleterious consequences of large-scale mining activity that it forecasts. Reversing this decision would undoubtedly be the wrong move, as the Pebble mine would jeopardize more jobs than it creates and put a renewable resource at risk. You have the rare opportunity to help maintain a fishery that is still healthy, for the benefit of commercial fishermen, sport fishermen, and the native Alaskans that rely on Bristol Bay for subsistence. I am not opposed to mining, but I strongly believe that Bristol Bay is the wrong place for it.

Sincerely,
Miles Sturm",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369-4945/attachment_1.rtf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369-4945/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Please  note the following: U.S. District Court Judge H. R. Holland dismissed PLP's challenge to the EPA's authority to perform a Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment; the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision. Judge Holland also ruled that PLP does not have a valid legal basis for stopping EPA's deliberations about whether it should block large scale mining. Regarding the remaining litigation, concerning whether the EPA acted improperly under the Federal Advisory Committee - by his unilateral decision to work behind the scenes with PLP and stop the litigation process, Administrator Pruitt excused PLP from having to provide proof for its allegations; there is high likelihood that the allegations were not supported by facts. Mr. Pruitt's actions robbed the EPA of a fair hearing and the public of the right to see evidence. I see no justification for Mr. Pruitt's actions here, actions connected with the proposal to withdraw the July 2014 Determination.

I oppose withdrawing the EPA's July 2014 Determination ""for the reasons stated."" Withdrawing the July 20d14 Determination would create more regulatory uncertainty, not less, as claimed. No justification for giving priority to PLP's possible ""perceived"" uncertainty is given nor is any justification apparent. No explanation for why the withdrawal is ""appropriate"" is given.

The proposal to withdraw the July 2014 Determination was made arbitrarily without due process after a private meeting with Tom Collier, CEO of PLP and without consulting with EPA staff.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Alaska's mining regulations are, I am told, among the most stringent of all the 50 States.  No mine can claim to build a tailing dam that will last into perpetuity, in the region with the most active volcanic and earthquake-prone area in North America.  

I understand that mining is critical;  ""If it's not grown, it's mined"" is a concept I'd not considered until I married a geologist.  However, with global population growth and hence an escalating need for food and clean (potable) water, building a mine of Pebble's magnitude is a mistake of global consequence.

I am writing in regard to Docket ID No. EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369 the decision that EPA rollback its 2014 Proposed Determination regarding the Pebble Ore deposit. At that time EPA likely correctly determined the proposed mine would compromise existing fishery resources, indigenous subsistence-based livelihoods.

The agency undertook an extensive three-year, twice-peer reviewed scientific assessment that found a mine like Pebble would have ""significant"" and potentially ""catastrophic"" impacts on the Bristol Bay watershed. The Pebble Mine would generate up to 10 billion tons of toxic mining waste, covering an area larger than Manhattan. Giant earthen dams some larger than 700 feet tall would be constructed to hold back the leach-prone mine tailings forever, all in an active earthquake zone. According to EPA's three year, twice peer reviewed scientific assessment of mining impacts on the Bristol Bay Watershedwhich evaluated three different mining scenarioseven the smallest mining scenario would destroy numerous miles of salmon streams and thousands of acres of wetlands.

It seems imperative that as a reasoning person I must comment that rolling back EPA's 2014 Proposed Determination though stipulated in settlements, is not in standing with the interests of our nations people, their well being and their security to a living resource, which provides us all with a sense of pride in our choice to preserve and protect that, that has been in-trusted to us  was created by none of the investors and is so important to those that rely on the pristine nature of this region for inspiration and or sustenance & domicile.

Particularly at this moment in time, when there is a question regarding the security of the living world, the integrity of our seated government and instability rampant throughout the world. Now would be a good time to trust the wisdom of those that have already researched the matter, to hear the message in the proposed Determination and start upholding the trust of the people to protect our interests which are the apparently valuable Pebble Ore deposit and our magnificent Bristol Bay Fishery.

Yep! there's likely gold there, maybe even a lot but wasting the landscape with a toxic extraction process is not how my folks raised me to behave as a conservator.

Nature owes man nothing. Folk coming around offering to liquidate the assets of our nation, leave the site poorer for their being there, there's not much good going to come from that, matter of fact it's likely poor asset management.

So please Sir or Madame let's get on with protecting the interests of our people.

Thank you,

Please reverse this disastrous plan to withdraw Clean Water Act restrictions on mining the Pebble deposit in Bristol Bay, Alaska. 

Your job is to protect this pristine and magical place that produces half the world's sockeye salmon and is one of the most valuable wild salmon fisheries on Earth.  It supports 14,000 jobs and Alaskans voted by an overwhelming margin in 2014 to protect it from such mines.

How dare you risk irreversible damage and 10 billion tons of toxic waste in service of foreign mining conglomerate?  And why?  Seriously why?  You not only risk defiling the environment, but permanently destroying thousands of jobs and the Alaskan economy against the will of the people.  

Your job is to protect the public interest and it is revolting and disgusting that Scott Pruitt would hide behind closed doors to do the bidding of corporate mining interests instead.  

Please don't let this happen.  Do your job.  Do what is so clearly the right thing.

Scott Pruitt's movement to lift mining restrictions on Alaska's Bristol Bay to use the site for dredged or fill material disposal associated with the Pebble deposit would be irreversibly detrimental to the area's ecosystem, jobs, and culture. Bristol Bay supplies approximately half of the world's sockeye salmon and is home to grizzly bears, wolves, caribou, wolverines, foxes, otters, moose, and thousands more species. An abundance of clean water enables them to thrive. Additionally, the area in question is seismically active, so it would be at high risk for toxic waste contamination (despite promises from Pebble and associates that this would not occur). Withdrawing Bristol Bay's protections under the Clean Water Act would defy years of scientific research, public comment, and independent review that led the EPA to determine in 2014 that mining the area would be a health risk for the fishery and broader ecosystem. With one of the world's most valuable salmon watersheds, Bristol Bay's fishery supports 14,000 jobs and is valued at over $1.5 billion annually. Additionally, more than 65% of Alaskans, 80% of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85% of commercial fishermen stand against the Pebble mine.

Please use common sense, the well-established research, and your human heart to consider the grave consequences of Pruitt's unreasonable, irrational, unjustifiable motion to withdraw Bristol Bay's protections under the Obama-era Clean Water Act. Respect our planet's ecosystems and Bristol Bay's people. Thank you.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Older mine sites throughout the country, established before Clean Water Act protections, provide examples of how mining waste can decimate fisheries. I have spent 5 years working in fisheries research and management in Montana, where many watersheds and fish populations are heavily impacted by mine pollution, even decades after mines in those watersheds have closed. One of those rivers, the Clark Fork, is downstream of Butte, a mining city on a copper deposit similar to the one at Pebble. In 1908, a flood washed mine tailings 120 miles downstream, creating what would later become the largest superfund site in the country. There were no fish in the Clark Fork for 80 years. Even today, 109 years after the flood, populations of trout are significantly lower than in nearby rivers.  It's bad enough for mine tailings to destroy a recreational trout fishery. The thought of a similar disaster happening in the most productive salmon fishery in the world is horrifying.

The geology of the Pebble area is not conducive to safely containing mine waste.  Furthermore, the mine's location upstream of Lake Iliamna means that any tailings dam failure or groundwater contamination has the potential to harm water quality and fish populations in an important sockeye salmon rearing habitat.  Please, learn from past examples of mine tailings decimating fisheries, and retain the Clean Water Act protections so the salmon fisheries in Bristol Bay are protected.

The EPA must prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed area. 

Just 3 years ago the EPA found that the proposed mine ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources."" The digging of massive pits and piling of waste rock would disrupt the streams in the area, and the discharge of waste chemicals would make the waters inhospitable to aquatic life. The EPA determined that the losses from this would be irreversible.

The Bristol Bay area fishery produces about half of the world's sockeye salmon, and these fish require clean streams to sustain their populations. Polluted water can kill both baby salmon that are developing, and the adult salmon that are on their way to spawn. Manually disrupting the existing waterways with pit mines will stop the adult salmon from returning to the streams they were hatched in, and chemical discharge and seepage into the waters will critically impact their ability to survive in those waters. If this proposed mine is allowed to do as it pleases, it will wipe out the salmon population. This will be disastrous for the thousands of families in the area that make their livings fishing for salmon, and it will take this nutritious and delicious fish off the menu for much of the world. 

I don't have a problem with mining on principle, but we must not allow short-term corporate interests to overpower all else. If this mining company strip-mines the area, they will make a pretty penny quickly. But they won't be employing nearly as many people as make their livelihoods fishing in the area. They won't be contributing to the local economy. And after they're done, the local economy will be done for as well. The salmon fishery has sustained local American families for decades, had sustained local Inuit families for centuries before them, and could continue to sustain families indefinitely if we take care of it right. The gold and copper ores in the ground in that area isn't going anywhere. We have plenty of time to work out non-disruptive, minimally-intrusive ways of slowly extracting it, without unduly disturbing local wildlife habitats. The East coast used to have valuable salmon fisheries, until industrialization poisoned their spawning waterways. Let's not screw this up again in Alaska. If we are to mine the area, we must be very careful and put strict restrictions on the impact to the local terrain and on the waste discharged into the waterways.

The Clean Water Act gives the EPA the means to protect this irreplaceable fishery for future generations. I urge you to do so.

Bristol Bay one of the world's most pristine places in the world, an extremely sensitive watershed in wild Alaska. This protection was given because Bristol Bay is home to one of world's largest and most pristine sockeye salmon fisheries; roughly half the world's wild sockeye salmon come from there.

That protection was based on decades of scientific research, years of study, and public comment using EPA's due process. This protection is an assurance to those who live in the area and rely on that environment for their way of life.  Salmon and other area ecological resources create some 14,000 full and part time jobs.  Generate about $480 million annually and support 4,000-year-old Alaskan Native Cultures.  And don't forget Salmon is an important food for many, both human and animal.  

What is wrong with sticking with the judgement of scientific studies, careful studies that took 3 years to complete.  Those various groups including the EPA did extensive scientific studies and determined that this area should never be opened to certain types of mining, period. There is NO project that merits the risk. 

It is suggested that the mine would bring 1,000 jobs up to 2,000 during actual construction but weigh that against the potential loss of 14,000 full and part time jobs that could result from the damage the mine would cause.  In other words, the actions of 2,000 could cost 14,000 their jobs and the world in they live would be irreparably damaged. Sounds like a lose lose proposal. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts. Again I urge you to continue the Clean Water protections for the Bristol Bay.

The Bristol Bay salmon run is the largest sockeye run in the world and the only sustainably-managed fish harvesting operation of its size. It serves as an example for the world of what can be accomplished through good environmental stewardship. The state of Alaska is to be commended for their support of the effort. 

The risk of contaminant release from mine-waste containment and dredge spoils - even if relatively minor -- has the potential to compromise the market for these fish through public perceptions of health risk. At the largest scale, contamination from mine waste has the potential to contaminate much of the salmon run for generations.

The risk assessment EPA conducted evaluated the potential impacts of large-scale mining on Bristol Bay's commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries, on native Alaskan peoples whose culture is strongly connected to salmon fishing. To protect these natural, economic and cultural resources, EPA found that discharge of dredged or fill material would violate the Clean Water Act. The conditions supporting the previous assessment have not changed and the Determination should not be withdrawn.

I live in California, where only a generation ago salmon harvest numbered in the millions. Poor management has resulted in total collapse of the runs and the end of the inland commercial fishery. We should not repeat this mistake in Bristol Bay.

In my humble opinion, you have done nothing to protect the environment and everything possible to degrade the mission of the EPA, so you should not have the position that you have been appoimted to.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

The Bristol Bay Salmon fisheries and the Clean Water Act are both extremely important to me as an American citizen, and I do not want to see either compromised in this withdrawn proposal. 

It is well known that the Bristol Bay Salmon runs are some of the world's most productive fisheries and have provided food and livelihoods for many Americans for generations, including myself and my neighbors. It is also becoming increasingly recognized how much the health of a watershed is reflected in the health of its fisheries, especially for highly migratory species like salmon. 

In this case, we have an obligation to protect Bristol Bay's salmon, its water, and the watershed that supports them both, so that the Bristol Bay fisheries will continue to provide food and jobs for generations to come. 

In the U.S., we only have to look at other once-great salmon rivers like the Columbia and Sacramento-San Joaquin and see that we took risks in those river systems at the expense of salmon fisheries. It should be obvious that we cannot be too careful with the Bristol Bay watershed. Far too much value is at stake, and I believe a simple long view, with our grandchildren and their grandchildren in mind, reveals the immense inter-generational value in Bristol Bay that is not worth risking.

Letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Acting Region 10 Administrator Michelle Pirzadeh

On behalf of the following 131,948 WWF-US Supporters

I am writing today to encourage the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect Bristol Bay, Alaska, from the proposed Pebble Mine that would threaten the region's irreplaceable fish and wildlife resources and the 14,000 jobs that depend on Bristol Bay's clean, healthy waters. EPA must keep the Bristol Bay 404(c) Proposed Determination in place to protect Bristol Bay, its salmon, waters, people, and sustainable economy from the proposed Pebble Mine.

EPA's own scientific study contains highly concerning facts: even without a mine disaster, construction of the Pebble deposit will destroy 94 miles of salmon streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, lakes and ponds. Overall, EPA concluded that mining the headwaters of the Bristol Bay river systems could cause irreparable harm to the valuable Bristol Bay fishery, wildlife, and people.

According to the EPA's own study, the Bristol Bay watershed provides vital habitat for 29 fish species, more than 190 bird species, and more than 40 terrestrial animals. All five species of Pacific salmonsockeye, Chinook, coho, chum and pinkspawn and rear in the pristine Bristol Bay watershed. The Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, producing approximately 46% of the world's wild sockeye harvest, creating $1.5 billion in economic output and nearly 20,000 jobs throughout the United States annually.

Because of its great ecological and economic value, I recommend the EPA keep in place the 404(c) Proposed Determination for Bristol Bay, Southwest Alaska. The reasonable restrictions included in that proposal will prevent unsustainable development that would adversely impact the region's fishery, recreation and local culture.

I then pick it up from their delivery trucks myself. Salmon are subsistence AND business for Alaskans for generations to come. Why invite a foreign mine to come and strip our lands, ruin our salmon runs and then leave with all their financial gains while we are stuck with the mess they will inevitably leave behind?

This will not bring jobs to Alaskans. Instead it will bring in people from the Outside, who will not pay taxes (because apparently we are too stupid as a state to require them) while using Alaska infrastructure. These people will then claim residency only long enough to claim a dividend...

I am opposed to EPAs proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

Many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical (much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats) and poses its own environmental risks. I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery.

Alaska is my home. All my time there, I have known that the Pebble Mine would lay waste to the people, the animals, and the ecosystem as a whole. The protections you wish to remove were created with science and our future in mind. By removing them, you hurt generations upon generations. These actions and the names of those who permitted them would stain the earth and our tongues. Please don't let that be.

An unprecedented coalition of native tribes, commercial fishermen, anglers and hunters, conservationists, religious groups, restaurateurs and outdoor enthusiasts have been fighting this foreign-owned mine proposal and trying to gain protections for the Bristol Bay region.

The reasons are simple and numerous. Bristol Bay's average run of 37.5 million fish produces a whopping 46% of the world's sockeye salmon. This run sustains more than 29,000 fishing trips each year and creates 14,000 commercial and recreational jobs in a salmon fishery that can last indefinitely, as opposed to the 1,000 or so jobs the Canadian mine developers can offer for a couple of decades.

The salmon's incredible migration also sustains people: nearly half of the world's sockeye catch comes from this one region, which is one of the last, great salmon fisheries on Earth. The returning salmon and other ecological resources create some 14,000 full- and part-time jobs, generate about $480 million annually -- and support 4,000-year-old Alaska Native cultures. 

Your EPA found after three years of peer-reviewed research, that such a mine ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, de-watering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in many areas of the bay watershed. In particular, the EPA estimated 22 miles of streams and more than 6 square miles of wetlands and other habitats that are important to salmon and other fish would be lost to a large-scale mine FOREVER.

Today I urged President Trump to listen to our fishermen and businesses before removing science-based environmental rules that protect Bristol Bay. The future of Bristol Bay must be determined by science, not politics or the whining of Tom Collier, who is only pursuing this mine for the benefit of his company.

The potential impacts of the proposed Pebble Mine on the health of the Bristol Bay watershed and the livelihood of thousands of people in Alaska are far too great. Salmon supporting streams are vulnerable to degradation, the area supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world and 25 federally recognized tribes who for 4,000 years have depended on the fishery as well as local non native salmon fishermen . The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the project, and a statewide majority of voters also oppose it.  EPAs original watershed assessment was scientifically based and leads to good policy.  That assessment and related public comments should strongly influence any future action.

The proposed mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. This was 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

Many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical - as they are much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats - and poses its own environmental risks. I ask the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery, both for the sake of the people who depend on it and for the fishery itself.

Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.

In addition, US now has surplus oil supplies and was granted permission by Congress to sell those surplusses overseas.  Not only is the Artic a sensitive area to drill in;  it is also difficult and very expensive.  I have heard news stories stating Exxon and other companies have had second thoughts on the economics of drilling in the Artic.  

therefore, since opening Brisol Bay and other areas may be a flight of fancy and a dream to raise billions of dollars in revenue for the Treasury, it may be a no go.  Keep your senses and don't allow it in the first place.

The returning salmon and other ecological resources create some 14,000 full- and part-time jobs, generate about $480 million annually -- and support 4,000-year-old Alaska Native cultures."" I FEEL THIS PROVES SUSTAINABLE VALUE AS IS. ""Such a mine ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of the bay watershed, the EPA found after three years of peer-reviewed research. In particular, the EPA estimated 22 miles of streams and more than 6 square miles of wetlands and other habitats that are important to salmon and other fish would be lost to a large-scale mine."" THIS IS BACKED BY SCIENCE. 
""All of these losses would be irreversible,"" the agency said.""Under the Obama administration, people were willing to say, 'Look, it's very clear, this is exactly the worst place you could imagine building a mine of that kind,"" said Ray Hilborn, a professor in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington. ""It's not just that you have the most valuable salmon fishery in the world, it's the nature of the habitat there. The reason it's such a productive salmon place is, it's basically this giant gravel bed. But that also means it's almost impossible to contain water. It's just a giant sponge. The idea you could store highly toxic waste (from a mine) forever behind a dam is just ridiculous.""Tilden says he's not anti-development. His father was a gold miner from California. But after the mine was first proposed, he said, he started touring mines that had been shut down. 
He saw pools of toxic water, massive piles of waste-rock. At one mine in Nevada, he said, he was told to cover his shoes for fear he would track dust laden with heavy metals home -- and ""not to have any contact with that dust with our eyes, not to touch any of the water.""
Could Bristol Bay turn into a similar wasteland? He decided he didn't want to find out.

I currently live in Alaska, and have since 1998.  I'm familiar with the permitting process (NEPA, etc.) and know that just because a project has impacts that does not result in disapproval of that activity...nor it should.  NEPA merely attempts to lessen those impacts and discloses the impacts.   Although scaled down, constructing a gold and copper mine in the headwaters of the world's most productive salmon fishery  - in a place that is seismically active - is taking a huge chance, one that can have irreversible consequences.  

Projects like this have the potential to require water treatment facilities for perpetuity, not to mention huge tailings dams that have been known to fail in recent times as part of ""modern"" mining projects.  

Consequently, I believe that the EPA did the right thing in this situation where it required Clean Water Act restrictions by addressing a problem that has contributed to the loss of salmon in so many other places...to where the government has spent vast quantities of money trying to bring back fish populations that have been decimated by habitat degradation.

The risk losing the last great sockeye salmon run to pollution from short-term mining interests is too great a risk. The regions waters must be fully protected.

Rigorous scientific study of the Bristol Bay watershed indicates it is one of the most productive, pristine, valuable and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America today.  The Agency's proposal to exclude mining was made at the request of the Native communities and came after extensive public participation and peer review.  Thousands of comments were submitted to support this determination.  Those comments should be taken into consideration before withdrawing the proposed Clean Water Protection determination.

Bristol Bay is home to over half of the world's sock-eye salmon spawning ground and more than 50 million wild salmon.  The area supports the traditional way of life for Indigenous Native Americans.  Commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300 million annually and supports 14,000 commercial and sport fishing jobs.  

I write in support of the communities of Alaska's Bristol Bay and ask you not to withdraw the proposed determination to adopt restrictions protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon.

The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and take all necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed.

My name is Gabriel Jacobson and I am a deckhand for a commercial fishing boat in Bristol Bay. I am from Seattle, and currently am in my senior year at Whitman College, as an Anthropology major. I began working in Bristol Bay because my dad did so in the 1970s, while working for Dillingham Legal Services as a public defender, and had some really intriguing stories to tell about his experiences. I had never been much of a fisherman before this, but once I became interested in fishing and worked in Bristol Bay for a few years, seeing the Incredible salmon runs, the beauty of their strength and persistence and courage, I have gained an immense interest in salmon and their importance to everyone who relies on them. My experience in Bristol Bay with the salmon involves not just commercial fishing for them on a boat, but watching them and fishing for them in the upper lakes of Wood-Tikchik State Park. 
The salmon runs in the pacific northwest are all but gone, thanks to moves by industrial american society towards the west and into indigenous lands. American local and federal policy has depleted the natural resources (such as salmon) that native peoples relied on not only as an incidental side effect, but as a strategy of colonization, resulting in the decimation and relocation of almost all indigenous Americans. Alaska, and particularly Bristol Bay is, in many ways, the last remaining hope and example for Pacific Northwest indians, in their subsistence way of life and its basis on salmon. 
I am currently conducting my senior thesis project at Whitman on the First Foods movement on the Umatilla reservation in Eastern Washington state. In the process of this project, I have spoken to a great number of people (mostly tribal members) who have expressed regret and hopefulness as to the decimation and return of the once colossal and vital salmon runs in BC, Washington, Oregon, and California. The only remaining reference they have for how things used to be, lies in Bristol Bay. Seeing what these salmon runs could be like (how they are in Bristol Bay), and seeing what they will become if development is allowed to go unchecked (how they are in most of the PNW)--makes me completely convinced that measures need to be taken, if not to put the Pebble mine operations to a complete halt, to further regulate and mitigate its effects.

In summary, the ecosystem that is at risk here is so vital to historically mistreated peoples, so fragile, and has been repeatedly mistreated to the extent that it makes no sense for the agency whose job it is to protect just those ecosystems to rescind its scientifically-based decision to protect it. There are so many livelihoods, so much land and sea, and so many lives at stake here that the EPA must do its job and protect our natural environment and its resources. 

Sincerely,

Gabriel Jacobson",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My understanding is that almost $1 billion has been expended on the project and some of the best experts in the world have addressed many of the concerns expressed about the environment, the local communities, etc. I further understand that:

   the permitting process will require full disclosure of all the issues and that during the process no harm will come to the environment
  during permitting, by law, it is incumbent on PLP to prove to regulators what impact the project may have on wetlands and fish habitat, and how it may mitigate any such impacts.  Why not give them that opportunity?; and
  PLP will be required to follow the law and due-process will be adhered to - that's why we have laws and guidelines.

Lastly, there are without a doubt, numerous benefits that could potentially flow to the econonmy and communities of Alaska but  to date all the focus has been on the negative - give the company the opportunity to present the positives and address the concerns so that a fair and balanced decision can be ultimately made.  What is the downside in that?

The proposed Pebble mine would put Bristol Bay at significant risk of severe environmental degradation, would devour an area almost the size of Anchorage Alaska, entail five huge earthen dams, the largest of which would be larger than the Gorges Dam in China and require substantial infrastructure development.
The Bristol Bay Proposed Determination was made pursuant to the Clean Water Act in 2014.  In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that the proposed Pebble mine would not jeopardize Bristol Bay.  The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.  Withdrawing the determination would ignore the overwhelming majority of Alaskans (65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents oppose the Pebble mine development), ignores peer reviewed scientific assessments and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs.

The facts have not changed.  Keep the 2014 Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

I support the EPA's withdrawal of the Proposed Determination on the Pebble Mine Project. This project must be properly
evaluated using the traditional NEPA permitting process, which will allow the full social, economic, and environmental impacts
of the project to be considered.

Withdrawal of the Proposed Determination will NOT harm the environment; it only allows the Pebble Partnership to engage in
the normal permitting process.  The conduct of the EPA over the last 40 years confirms that its issuance of a preemptive veto 
is unprecedented.  The EPA has only exercised its authority under Section 404(c) thirteen times.  In each instance, the EPA 
invoked Section 404(c) only after receipt of a permit application that described the scope and details of the project being 
proposed, the anticipated environmental impact, and techniques to be employed to mitigate or control that impact.  In 2015, 
the House Oversight Committee concluded that ""the EPA's use of a preemptive veto (at Pebble) was unprecedented and 
without a legal basis.""  The Committee went on to describe the EPA's course of action as ""an unprecedented change in the 
agency's process for regulating resource and development projects,"" and called on the EPA to ""cease all preemptive 404(c) 
activity"" to allow for the normal permitting process to take place.

The Proposed Determination must be withdrawn to remedy the EPA's prior overreach.  Under the Clean Water Act, the Corps 
of Engineers has the authority to grant permits while the EPA only has the authority to veto permits, not impose pre-permit 
restrictions on development over large areas of land.  Rather than waiting for PLP to file a Section 404 permit application, and 
adhering to the traditional permitting process, EPA commissioned an assessment of the Bristol Bay region - the flawed Bristol 
Bay Watershed Assessment.  Many Alaska industry and trade associations expressed concern about the EPA abandoning the 
normal process for evaluating projects such as Pebble.  They joined with national trade associations in expressing this 
concern multiple times.  Removing the Proposed Determination is an important step in returning fair and due process to the 
EPA.  The rules and the rule of law matter. 

Withdrawing the Proposed Determination will have a variety of beneficial effects. It will show voters that due process is still 
followed and respected in this country. And it will provide a signal to the investing community that the United States is in fact 
still open to innovation, opportunity, and job creation.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment on this proposal.

I am writing you today to ask that you stand with American jobs and communities and not withdraw the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination, which it made pursuant to the Clean Water Act in 2014 (Docket EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369).

As you are well aware, Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs. 

I urge you to listen to the voices of those who have spoke out, and for the sake of the Bristol Bay watershed, its world-class salmon fishery and its people, keep the door closed on Pebble Mine. If you don't, you will have to answer to me and hundreds of thousands of people in Alaska and across the United States and the world who stand in fervent opposition to this toxic mega-mine. 

Sincerely,

Eric Buchanan",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Their report contains very little accessible raw data where their conclusions can be independently evaluated. Having looked specifically at their conclusions regarding surface and groundwater (where all their modeling is based on only one faulty well drilled to the proposed mine depth), I can say that the studies have been woefully inadequate. The surface and groundwater conditions are vital to the survival of the last fully intact salmon fishery in the world.

The Pebble Limited Partnership has asked the scientific community to not judge the proposed mine based on the past failures of nearly every large-scale mining operation, but to take their work that somehow they have designed a mine that would adequately predict and mitigate for all possible contingencies. Rather than presenting these designs to the public and to EPA during the 404(c) review process, PLP withheld that information, so the EPA was forced to use PLP's older proposed design specifications and current industry best management practices to evaluate whether or not to take action. 

EPA's analysis was peer reviewed by a wide range of technical experts, including mining professionals and industry experts before reaching the conclusion that under current best practices, the proposed mine would not be able to operate without adversely affecting the watershed. While the PLP trucked out a long series of paid consultants to dispute the EPA's findings, not a single one of them presented a case for a design that would protect the Bristol Bay Watershed; they only commented on the technical flaws of EPA's general evaluative design. 

The NEPA process is quite valuable for carefully evaluating the impacts of a proposed project, but is not free from the influence of special interest groups and political pressure. The best decision for the environment is frequently trumped by promises of ""world-class"" mitigation that is dropped once the project has been approved and the financial realities of the mitigation are realized. One great example of this was the promised use of double-hulled vessels for hauling oil from the pipeline out of Valdez. The oil companies paraded technical specifications of the latest and greatest double-hulled ships that they all vowed to use for transportation during the NEPA process. Once the approvals were finished, the companies successfully argued that these ships were too expensive and were then allowed to use less protective ships that led to the Exxon Oil Spill; the last major environmental disaster to hit Alaska.

The Watershed Assessment that was conducted by your agency was done in a transparent and public manner, giving all stakeholders a voice in the process. The assessment was peer reviewed by environmental and industry professionals and their input was used to inform the final decision based on established EPA policy. Just because there is new political pressure does not invalidate these analyses and the EPA should not withdraw the determination.

EPA must keep the Bristol Bay 404(c) Proposed Determination in place to protect Bristol Bay, its salmon, waters, people, and sustainable economy from the proposed Pebble Mine.

EPA's own scientific study contains highly concerning facts: even without a mine disaster, construction of the Pebble deposit will destroy 94 miles of salmon streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, lakes and ponds. Overall, EPA concluded that mining the headwaters of the Bristol Bay river systems could cause irreparable harm to the valuable Bristol Bay fishery, wildlife, and people.
According to the EPA's own study, the Bristol Bay watershed provides vital habitat for 29 fish species, more than 190 bird species, and more than 40 terrestrial animals. All five species of Pacific salmonsockeye, Chinook, coho, chum and pinkspawn and rear in the pristine Bristol Bay watershed. The Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, producing approximately 46% of the world's wild sockeye harvest, creating $1.5 billion in economic output and nearly 20,000 jobs throughout the United States annually.
Because of its great ecological and economic value, I recommend the EPA keep in place the 404(c) Proposed Determination for Bristol Bay, Southwest Alaska. The reasonable restrictions included in that proposal will prevent unsustainable development that would adversely impact the region's fishery, recreation and local culture.
Please keep the agency's 404(c) action in place to protect one of the nation's greatest sustainable resourcesthe Bristol Bay, Alaska, salmon fishery.

Further, in the event a decision were to be made allowing the withdrawal of the proposed determination I would urge the EPA Administrator to review and reconsider that decision. 

The purpose of the restrictions is to protect a watershed that is among other things home to the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world, supporting commercial, sport, personal and traditional subsistence use. It depends on healthy, intact ecosystems which would be jeopardized by mining activity. The ability of commercially harvested seafood from the region to command top prices in international markets depends upon the purity of the seafood, and upon the world renowned purity of the environment from which it comes. Healthy, intact ecosystems are not to be squandered, particularly when the ecological and economic consequences are dire. The resources involved have value not only to Alaskans, but to the nation and to the world.

My perspective is shaped by a quarter century of professional experience. I spent a dozen years working for members of the Alaska State Legislature representing coastal communities deeply reliant on the Alaska seafood industry, and whose residents also participated in sport, personal use and subsistence activities.  I spent a couple of years working for Alaska's largest commercial fishing organization, United Fishermen of Alaska. I spent another dozen years as director with Alaska's international seafood marketing arm (the Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, established by the commercial harvesters and seafood processors of Alaska's commercial seafood industry).

The proposed plan to reverse the clean water rule applied to Bristol Bay is shortsighted and potentially devastating. The pristine wilderness of Alaska, and Bristol Bay in particular, are an important source of one of the last remaining and healthy wild salmon runs. A mine has the potential to forever contaminate and destroy a sensitive and valuable ecosystem. This decision goes against science and the work of the people of Alaska to safeguard their land. This is a backroom deal that is beneath the office of the head of the EPA to engage in. I am deeply disappointed in this decision and respectfully ask that you maintain the protections on our waterways and land. That land belongs to ALL americans and NOT a Canadian owned mining company.

To even think about mining this ore body is insane. Acid waters will form. The earthen dam will leak. There is no humanly possible way to prevent wholesale destruction of the fisheries, should this mine be developed. Such development WILL destroy the fisheries and the rest of the aquatic ecosystem...for thousands of years, at least.

As someone who cares that healthy rivers, salmon, fishing communities, and native peoples exist when my 4-year-old is my age, I heartily oppose the construction of any mine or deposit area in or around Bristol Bay, Alaska. 

Would a mine and deposit area provide jobs in the short-term? Yes. But mineral deposits are finite. Let's not also forget the enormous, intangible value of salmon as part of Alaska's cultural heritage, and the mainstay for an entire ecosystem of bears, eagles, other fish, and humans. Salmon-fishing is a $1.5 billion RENEWABLE industry, supporting over 14,000 jobs, not just right now, but into the future. Consider, too, the $90 million fishing and outdoor-related tourism to Bristol Bay brings to Alaska. 

Development of the area is not just short-sighted, it's greedy and places the values of consumption over the value of life and the very existence of our planet's most incredible resources. In 2013, the final Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment found that a mine the size, type and location of Pebble will almost definitely harm Bristol Bay's salmon.

I do not want some place as magnificent as Bristol Bay to be turned into the next Conga Mine (or take your pick of the devastating extractive projects throughout Latin America, Africa, and Asia), where environmental destruction doesn't only impact the land, but it also breeds conflict and violence.

In summary, please do not withdraw the restricted use determination of the Pebble Deposit Area. The forever risks are too high for the time-limited rewards. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear EPA:

Please do not withdraw the EPA Region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination that was issued pursuant of the Clean Water Act.   As an Alaskan who has visited Bristol Bay and knows first hand the value of the incredible salmon fishery there, I supported EPA's determination ""to restrict the use of certain waters in the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds in southwest Alaska as disposal sites for dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit, a copper-, gold-, and molybdenum-bearing ore body.""  

Regardless of why EPA agreed to initiate this proposed withdrawal process, the determination should not be withdrawn.  The  Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP)'s subsidiaries may own the mineral claims to the Pebble deposit, but they do not own the land, the water, the fish.  Alaskans who depend on the land, the water, the fish do not support PLP or its subsidiaries, and they have been testifying so to EPA.  I hope you are listening.  

The mine, whether in its supposedly smaller form or in its potentially monstrous form, cannot be build without poisoning the land and water, and that means the fishery will be destroyed too, and we are talking millions of wild salmon.  These wild salmon are important not only to Alaskan but to other  Americans too.  Commercial fishermen and sport fishing visitors are a huge factor in Alaska's economy, and should not be put in jeopardy in order to support the foreign owned PLP.  These salmon feed Americans from local subsistence users to families all over the United States.  

EPA's determination was not made lightly.  It was made after extensive scientific research, consideration of impacts, and public comments.  It's hard to believe that this administration would put the interests of a foreign company above the interests of Americans, but that's sure what it looks like.   I hope I'm wrong and EPA will do the right thing and leave the determination in place.

I am writing to express my opposition to the EPA's May 2017 settlement agreement with Pebble Partnership (a more benign sounding name for Northern Dynasty Mining Company, a Canadian corporation and 100% owner of Pebble Partnership).  The EPA determined back in 2014 that the Clean Water Act prohibited the type of project Northern Dynasty Mining Company had proposed for Bristol Bay.  Yet despite this conclusion, in May of 2017 the EPA agreed to a settlement with Northern Dynasty Mining Company.  In a nutshell, the settlement terms were as follows: Northern Dynasty would drop the lawsuits it filed against the EPA in exchange for the EPA agreeing to withdraw its regulatory conclusion that Northern Dynasty Mining Company's proposed mining operation violated the Clean Water Act.  The public was not allowed to engage, comment, or otherwise take part in the settlement, which was negotiated behind closed doors.

Scott Pruitt, the EPA Administrator heralded the settlement, noting that while the EPA was ""committed to due process and the rule of law... [the settlement would] help steer EPA away from costly and time-consuming litigation...""  Yet Pruitt's assertion completely contradicts due process and the rule of law.  The EPA made its Clean Water Act ruling in 2014, prompting Northern Dynasty Mining Company to immediately file suit, as Northern Dynasty Mining Company was entitled to do.  But now, with the settlement, the EPA is simply allowing Northern Dynasty Mining Company to submit its permit despite the EPA having already determined the proposed mine would violate the Clean Water Act.  In effect, the EPA's settlement completely nullifies due process and the rule of law, which dictate that the matter is settled vis--vis the Administrative Agency (the EPA) and the Northern Dynasty Mining Company.  If the Northern Dynasty Mining Company wants to fight the EPAs's ruling, they should do so through the Judicial Branch.  That is the very purpose behind our Constitution's three branches of government, which the settlement completely circumvents.  

In 2016, Donald Trump ran on a pledge to put America first.  Yet nothing could be more antithetical to putting Americans first than allowing foreign profiteers to bypass the Clean Water Act and imperil Bristol Bay's unparalleled salmon fishery, which accounts for over 14,000 American jobs!  Thus, I request that the EPA live up to its name as the Environmental Protection Agency, which begins by not agreeing to a backroom settlement with a foreign mining company that not only circumvents the rule of law, but also risks American jobs and American resources.

I am opposed to the EPA's decision to withdraw Clean Water Act restrictions for the Pebble Mine. As professional civil engineer for a local municipality, I work to protect the waters of the state of Minnesota. As directed by the state of Minnesota, city engineers enforce the Clean Water Act. I want to continue to protect our waters for future generations. Rescinding the Clean Water Act means returning to a time when unregulated companies can threaten our country's water. I oppose the action for the following reasons:

 First, the facts have not changed. The proposed Pebble Mine would sit at the headwaters of Bristol Bay's watershed, which is home to record wild salmon runs exceeding 50 million fish annually. Bristol Bay's $1.5 billion annual sustainable commercial fishery provides 14,000 jobs and supplies half of the world's sockeye salmon. Salmon are not only the linchpin of the region's economy, but also its lifeblood, providing food, a subsistence-based livelihood, and the sustainable foundation for the language, spirituality, and social structure of its tribal communities.

 Second, the science has not changed. The Pebble Mineas last proposed by the Pebble Limited Partnership to its investors and the US Securities and Exchange Commissionwould generate up to 10 billion tons of toxic mining waste, covering an area larger than Manhattan and filling a major football stadium up to 3,900 times. Giant earthen damssome larger than 700 feet tallwould be constructed to hold back the leach-prone mine tailings forever, all in an active earthquake zone. According to the EPA's three-year, twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of mining impacts on the Bristol Bay Watershedwhich evaluated three different mining scenarioseven the smallest mining scenario would destroy numerous miles of salmon streams and thousands of acres of wetlands. Contrary to comments by the backers of the Pebble Mine project, the EPA's watershed assessment was scientifically based and thoroughly peer-reviewed, and the public has had an extensive opportunity to comment on it. The assessment and public comments received should be key components of any future action on this issue.

 Third, the rationale for the proposed withdrawal is flawed. Finalizing the proposed determination would provide much more regulatory certainty than withdrawing it, and a permit application is not needed to augment the factual record.

 Most important, the opposition has not changed. More than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen oppose the mine. The world opposes the mine too. Last year, the IUCN World Conservation Congress virtually unanimously adopted a motion opposing the Pebble Mine

The EPA's decision to withdraw Clean Water Act restrictions for the Pebble Mine is a mistake and goes against the spirit of the Clean Water Act. The peer-reviewed watershed assessment clearly illustrates the potently hazard this mine poses to the environment, economy, and way of life of hundreds of thousands of citizens.

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act states that discharge of dredged material may not be permitted if the nation's waters would be significantly degraded. The Pebble Mine is a massive and high risk operation that would undoubtedly cause a negative impact on one of the United States' most prolific and economically important watersheds. The EPA's assessment of mining impacts states that the probability of a failure in the product concentrate, return water, and diesel pipeline is 95% in the next 25 years, a concentrate spill in a stream or wetland is likely to occur at least once in the next 78 years, and an eventual failing of the water collection and treatment is certain. Additionally, truck accidents, culvert blockages, and tailings spills are all likely to occur. Any one of these disasters could have a serious impact on the watershed's significant salmon population (most notably, 46% of the global sockeye population), and for this reason, the EPA must not withdraw the proposed determination, and take all possible measures to prevent mining development from occurring in the Bristol Bay region. The Bristol Bay watershed is key habitat for 29 fish species, including all 5 Pacific salmon species. The salmon industry alone supports 14,000 jobs (significantly more than the 2,000 jobs created by the Pebble Mine), generates $1.5 billion in economic output. The salmon are also a key to the continued health of the Bristol Bay region, as the serve as an important annual nutrient source for the surrounding wildlife and soil. The high productivity of this ecosystem is due in large part to the pristine and undeveloped nature of the watershed, making the Pebble Mine a dangerous and unwarranted threat to not only the ecosystem, but to the livelihoods of thousands of Americans, including numerous native people who have been sustainably fishing the land for centuries. This is why 86.2% of fisherman in the area are opposed to the development of the mine. Furthermore, the mine has a predicted lifespan of only about 100 years, while the salmon fishery, if left undisturbed, could last in perpetuity. It does not make sense to degrade one of the most ecologically and economically important ecosystems of the United States for the sake of a short-term, foreign-owned development operation whose impact will be irreversible. The EPA is allowed to reject a company's ability to apply for permits if a water source will be significantly degraded, and it is clear from the EPA's initial assessment that the dangers posed by the Pebble Mine are far too great to warrant a permit application. I urge the EPA to maintain its initial Proposed Determination and to place the health of Bristol Bays ecosystem and human population at the forefront of their decision making.

I am writing to voice my opposition to the withdrawal of the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination and Clean Water Act protections for the Bristol Bay Watershed.This is one of the last, if not the last, healthy salmon fisheries in the world.It is a resource that provides over 14000 + jobs and millions of dollars annually to the world economy.This watershed is responsible for nearly half of the worlds sockeye salmon.



If this place is destroyed by mining, it will never recover.It is imperative that we protect this natural resource in a sustainable way that will not only provide jobs and resources now, but for generations to come. One of the reasons that makes our nation so great is that we have come together as a people to protect national treasures such as this. This is a time that we need to take action to preserve unique and fragile ecosystems such as the Bristol Bay watershed.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. Living in Seattle, it is clear to me that seafood is a vital and tenuous American industry that we must strive to protect.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs and the prosperity that comes from such rich ocean resource. 

Please do not withdraw the proposed determination!

I believe the EPA's original determination was founded in scientific evidence and logic. The proposed mining activities at Pebble Mine have a high likelihood of negatively impacting the pristine ecosystem in southwest Alaska. Although the Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP) claims it can construct and operate this mine in harmony with the environment, I find this extremely doubtful. Once the mining operation begins, any failure at a mine of this magnitude would be catastrophic. As is evident throughout human history, avoiding all mistakes is impossible. Given the geological qualities of the area as being less stable, unexpected tailing dam failures or other ecological disasters are not unlikely. To allow this proposed mining operation to occur would be gross negligence on the part of the EPA.

Considering the extreme risks associated with this proposed mining project, the public is left with a choice between the salmon industry and the Pebble Mine. This portion of the world is renowned for it's salmon fishery, worth more than $1 billion dollars US. The most significant aspect of this industry is that it is renewable- so long as adult salmon continue to have access to clean freshwater systems for spawning. The salmon industry could potentially continue harvesting fish for many decades to come. In contrast, the Pebble Mine is not a renewable resource, and once the available minerals are obtained there will be no further income generated. PLP claims that the Pebble Mine will bring jobs to southwest Alaska, while ignoring the thousands of jobs that their project will put at risk.

In conclusion, I am opposed to the EPA's proposal to withdraw it's proposed determination. I believe the unique ecosystem of Bristol Bay needs to be protected, and the proposed Pebble Mine threatens the Alaskan environment. Although Pebble Mine could potentially generate jobs and revenue, these benefits would only be temporary and not worth the high risk to the currently thriving salmon industry. The logical choice is to protect Alaska's environment, salmon industry, and future by rejecting the Pebble Mine project and upholding the previous Proposed Determination.

Please prohibit the storage and/or disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.The Bristol Bay 2017 harvest of all salmon species was 39.8 million fish; ranking second over the last 20 years (1997-2016) and worth a preliminary estimated value of $214.6 million almost double the 20-year average of $108.9 million and ranks second during that time frame , as reported by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Division of Commercial Fisheries.
Mines come and go, but leave waste behind from the processing of ore, which under current methods is stored on-site for centuries. Bristol Bay is an earthquake heavy region making it almost certain that storage of tailings (toxic semi-liquid mine waste) will fail. January 24, of last year, Southern Alaska experienced a 7.1 magnitude earthquake that cracked roadways. It should be noted that this would be classified as a major earthquake capable of causing serious damage. In Bristol bay, this waste would most likely be Acid Mine Drainage due to oxidation of unearthed pyrite,  or ""fool's gold"" which is often found in conjunction with valuable metals.

Bristol Bay  has been called  the  ""Salmon factory of the world"", offers five species of Salmon: King, Sockeye, Chum, Pink and Silver Salmon along with 7 species of fresh water fish: Rainbow Trout, Arctic Char, Arctic Grayling, Dolly Varden, Lake Trout and Northern Pike.Many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical (much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats) and poses its own environmental risks. I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery. The short-term gains of mining projects in the area outweighed by the long term risk to the environment and the economy. Please continue to ensure the well-being of this vital waterway by enforcing the EPA region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination.""

Re: Docket No. EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369
I strongly oppose withdrawal of the 2014 EPA Proposed Determination1.
I believe that the EPA has authority under Part 231 Section 404(c) procedures to prohibit or withdraw specification of any defined area as a disposal site regardless of whether a specific application has been filed for an area2. The EPA had legal authority to issue the 2014 Proposed Determination.
The EPA's 2014 findings showed the detrimental impact a large-scale mining operation would have on Bristol Bay fisheries and wildlife, and on the Alaska Native culture of the region.
I urge the EPA to retain the 2014 EPA Proposed Determination in the event a Recommended Determination is required after the terms of the 2017 Settlement Agreement between the EPA and Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP) have been met. The Settlement Agreement provides (Section III.A.1.),
If PLP does not submit a CWA Section 404 Permit Application regarding the Pebble
deposit to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) within 30 months from the
Effective Date of the Settlement Agreement, the Regional Administrator or his/her
designee may, at any time thereafter, forward a signed Recommended Determination and administrative record to EPA Headquarters pursuant to 40 C.F.R.  231.5(b).
Accordingly, the EPA must have its Proposed Determination ready for development into a Recommended Determination should PLP not timely file a CWA Section 404 Permit Application. If the existing 2014 Proposed Determination were withdrawn, the EPA would be required to develop, at great time and expense, a new proposed determination and to follow the lengthy public notice procedures pursuant to Section 404(c) Part 231.3. The EPA already has completed these procedures in developing the 2014 Proposed Determination and it would be redundant and costly to repeat them.
In the event that PLP timely files a CWA Section 404 Permit Application for the Pebble deposit,
the Settlement Agreement provides (Section III.A.1.),
The Regional Administrator or his/her designee may not forward a signed
Recommended Determination and administrative record to EPA Headquarters
pursuant to 40 C.F.R.  231.5(b) until EPA publishes a notice in the Federal Register
of the final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) regarding PLP's Permit
Application pursuant to 40 C.F.R.  1506.lO(a) or 48 months from the Effective Date
of the Settlement Agreement, whichever is earlier in time.
The Settlement Agreement essentially provides for a DELAY in the Regional Administrator's
actions on the 2014 Proposed Determination; the Agreement does not provide for a
WITHDRAWAL of the Proposed Determination, therefore a withdrawal is premature and unnecessary, and a review of this decision by the Administrator would not add value and should not be required.
I vehemently oppose the proposed Pebble Mine. 
There are innumerable reasons why the PLP proposal for a mine at the Pebble site should
never, ever be considered or permitted:
The proposed mine conflicts with the stated mission of this administration to create jobs. Jobs
already exist in the region and would be sacrificed for a foreign owned mining company that
will take profits from the region elsewhere and leave devastation in its wake. There is no
justification for the sacrifice of the livelihood and lifestyle of local U.S. citizens for a foreign
owned mine:
- Alaska Natives, who are U.S. citizens, have lived in the region for 10,000 years and 7,500
subsistence peoples harvest 2.4 million pounds of fish a year worth $143 million a year;
- Commercial fisherman, also U.S. citizens, contribute, from this LARGEST commercial sockeye
fishery in the world, 51% of global catch at a total value of $1.5 billion and 14,000 jobs annually;
- Sport fishing generates $160 million annually from over 13,000 anglers from out of state
who spend $75 million and create 1200 jobs.
The sacrifice of local jobs is a certainty because no mine of the magnitude of that proposed by PLP has avoided the devastating effects of spills and leaching of toxic chemicals. The footprint of the proposed mine alone would destroy 100 miles of irreplaceable sensitive salmon habitat. The resulting disposal sites would need to be maintained IN PERPETUITY- FOREVER- after PLP have made their money and moved on. PLP and associated companies cannot guarantee that a mine at the Pebble site will not destroy the most pristine and valuable salmon habitat IN THE WORLD!
In summary, I believe that the EPA issuance of the 2014 Proposed Determination was the right action at the right time; I strongly oppose withdrawal of the 2014 Proposed Determination; I oppose a review by the Administrator of the decision in this docket regarding withdrawal of the 2014 Proposed Determination; AND I strongly oppose the PLP proposed mine at the Pebble site.

Applicants claim that building the mine will create jobs. However, the jobs created pale in comparison to the jobs already supported by the natural resource represented by the wild Pacific salmon runs. Consider that The Bristol Bay commercial fishery is valued at $1.5 billion annually and provides over 14,000 sustainable jobs. This does not include sport fishing's contribution of a total of  $1.4 billion on fishing trips, fishing equipment, and development and maintenance of land in 2007 in Alaska. Additionally, the 846 full- and part-time jobs in Bristol Bay, accounting for $27 million in total wages and benefits paid to employees and proprietors.

These numbers far exceed the estimated employment and total regional economic benefit proposed by the mine. So from a purely Alaska-centric view of jobs and total regional economic impact, the current existing economy is superior to the proposal from Northern Dynasty.

The ecological impact, which often gets swept under the rug in corporate filings, is a much more significant, and frightening prospect. The scope of the proposed mine is massive, even if the owners proposed to ""downsize"" the footprint, currently the size of Manhattan. The tailings impoundment alone needed to support such a huge operation would have to be mammoth. Nearly the depth of the Grand Canyon and several square miles in dimension, which by legal definition would have to hold the toxic byproduct of the mining process in perpetuity. This, perhaps is the most disturbing aspect of this entire issue. One need look no further than the recent, disastrous failure of the Mt. Polley Mine, which caused more than 26 million square yards of toxic copper, selenium and arsenic to be spilled into Hazeltine Creek, which fed the toxic waste into Quesnel Lake. Scientists are still trying to determine the long-term effects on local ecosystems, including fish, birds and other animals that depend on the watershed.

Now imagine that type of spill on a much larger scale at the headwaters of the world's largest wild salmon run, which includes the most significant sockeye salmon run. The devastation would be catastrophic in terms of ecological AND economic impacts. All of the jobs and billions of dollars tied to commercial and recreational fishing alone would likely be lost for a long term. There is no guarantee that if such a spill were to occur, that the salmon would ever come back...without suffering long-lasting damage to the gene pool. 

Finally, consider that more than 60% of Alaskans recently voted to support a measure that would ensure that any such mine that is proposed in ecologically sensitive areas --as Pebble is -- must be subjected to final state approval regarding watershed impact. In other words, Alaskans don't want the mine. 

So, if a majority of Alaskans DON'T want the mine, and likely most if not all commercial and both in-state and out-of-state recreational fishermen DON'T want the mine, and if most Native American tribes DON'T want the mine, AND the inherent risk of a devastating tailings impoundment failure looms, why build it? Moreover, why build it here?

I agree with the sentiment, Wrong Place, Wrong Mine. I say this as an educator talking to students of any age about sustainable seafood and the many impacts we have on seafood as a resource. I say this as a recreational fishermen who cares about the resource. And I say this as a father, who is teaching his daughter about the vital connection we have to nature, and the importance of balancing our needs as a modern society with preserving priceless natural resources.

Please do not void the very mission of the EPA and ignore the framework of the Clean Water Act. Doing so would only benefit a small percentage of people at the expense of much, much more.

Not only would it kill off half of the world's sockeye salmon population, but it would also ruin the livelihoods of the people who depend on these fish for food and money. It would also devastate Alaska's economy- while the metals produced by that mine may cushion it somewhat, Alaska as a whole is incredibly dependent on this vast source of food and income. Installing a mine wouldn't even come close to compensating for the losses that these people would suffer- not only to their jobs and earnings, but also to their homes. Seeing the beautiful place they have lived in and depended on for their entire lives be turned into an industrial nightmare would be unimaginably hard to cope with. This one mine is not worth the irreparable damage that would be done to the landscape, the ecosystem, the economy, or the people living there.

These watersheds form the heart of the last wild salmon fishery left in the world. The primary reason this fishery is an economic powerhouse of commercial and sport fishing is that the spawning, rearing, and migratory habitat in this area remain essentially undeveloped. Pacific salmon are unable to withstand the cumulative and far-reaching effects of modern economic development. Of all industries, mining is demonstrably incompatible with the life history and habitat requirements of Pacific salmon. To date, no large-scale mining project has shown the ability to minimize negative effects on aquatic biota to the degree by which the Pebble Partnership ensures it will safeguard freshwater resources in Bristol Bay.
Additionally, my husband is a commercial fisherman in Bristol Bay. His livelihood and our family's income depends on the health and long-term sustainability of the fishery. If the EPA cannot protect the surface and groundwater of this world treasure resource, then Bristol Bay's fishery may be lost like too many other salmon populations. Cascading effects on subsistence lifestyles, economy, and culture must be considered in weighing the merits of reopening Bristol Bay to this large-scale mining project. I ask that you do not remove the 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination, on behalf of people and fish.

The salmon greatly impact the economy, and not only aid Alaskan natives in surviving in the economy brought upon us, but enrich everyone in the coastal rural areas of Alaska. Yes, Alaska is owned by the U.S., but rural Alaskans should at least have some say in the vote. Statistically, all the places in Alaska that were won over by Donald Trump, were heavily populated city's and not a rural place thriving off of the salmon run. Yes, salmon seasons have their bad years, but that's what makes the good seasons good. Donald Trump is a great person, but should not be making the decision on the pebble mine. He will not have to see the impact after the mine is through, and will not have to suffer if all the salmon are poisoned. I may only be in college and not as successful as Trump, but I am the future.

The Proposed Determination imposes common-sense restrictions that would protect Bristol Bay's wildlife, jobs, and communities from the dangerous Pebble Mine.  It should be approved as a Final Determination.

Pebble Mine threatens the grizzly bears and more than 250 species of fish and wildlife that depend on Bristol Bay's pure waters and pristine habitat for survival.  Pebble Mine threatens 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries and the most valuable wild salmon fishery in the world.

More than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen oppose the Pebble Mine.

I urge you to listen to those voices and put the long-term health of the Bristol Bay watershed and its people, wildlife and world-class salmon fishery above the short-term interests of a foreign mining company.
 
Please retain and finalize the Proposed Determination.""

The potential impacts of the proposed Pebble Mine on the health of the Bristol Bay watershed and the livelihood of thousands of people in Alaska are far too great. Those risks include loss of up to up to 94 miles of salmon-supporting streams and up to 4,900 acres of wetlands and ponds, and the very real potential of wastewater dam failure resulting in damage to or destruction of the salmon fishery. The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world and 25 federally recognized tribes who for 4,000 years have depended on the fishery for their subsistence-based culture. The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the project, and a statewide majority of voters also oppose it. The watersheds unique ecological resources generate significant economic benefits and employment. EPAs original watershed assessment was scientifically robust and thoroughly peer-reviewed. That assessment and related public comments should strongly influence any future action.

The prospect of a hardrock mineral mining operation as such gargantuan proportions as envisioned by Northern Dynasty would devastate an exquisitely sensitive watershed and the rich productivity of aquatic life, capped by a salmon population of awesome fecundity. The food chain of Bristol Bay is inextricably dependent upon a watershed that yields a reliably low sediment, high-oxygen water supply. The proposed mining operation would disfigure and transform the watershed, with a sprawling network of infrastructure bleeding sediment at every rain, exposed ore seams that shed acidic runoff, and large pits that interrupt the subterranean movement of water.
 
Bristol Bay epitomizes the aquatic resources that EPA was entrusted to protect through the Clean Water Act 404(c) review process, and it has done so correctly. You have a sacred moral obligation, as well as a legal responsibility as EPA Administrator, to protect this priceless of vital aquatic ecosystem. The Clean Water Act enshrines Americas determination that certain levels of aquatic ecosystem destruction are unacceptable, and the transparent, scientifically rigorous process conducted by EPA found correctly that Bristol Bay epitomizes this category.
 
Bristol Bay salmon support thousands of fishermen from across Alaska, the west coast, and other parts of the nation who descend on this remote and pristine region every summer to harvest the ""red gold.""  The fishery represents a multi-million dollar industry whose impact is felt across the country. Salmon are also the life-blood of local village economies and support centuries old subsistence traditions of the Native cultures in western Alaska. The compelling, overriding importance of Bristol bays intact ecosystem is illustrated by the support for EPAs finding among both Native and Anglo Alaskans, who traditionally and well-disposed to resource development, but correctly recognized the singular importance of Bristol Bay.
 
This ecosystem is a priceless treasure; the minerals and the trinkets they would be used to manufacture are not. Even if EPA limits its analysis to a mere utilitarian calculation of economic productivity, no question exists that maintaining the salmon production is more valuable than any mineral extraction. Any dilution or repeal of the prior administrations Clean Water Act finding would be a gross miscarriage and abdication of your responsibility.

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value. It is extremely irresponsible to sacrifice this vital and flourishing industry and its unique environs for the sake of mineral extraction which can be obtained in less ecologically sensitive deposits.

In addition, many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical (much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats) and poses its own environmental risks. I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery.

Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

An unprecedented coalition of native tribes, commercial fishermen, anglers and hunters, conservationists, religious groups, restaurateurs and outdoor enthusiasts have been fighting this foreign-owned mine proposal and trying to gain protections for the Bristol Bay region.

The reasons are simple and numerous. Bristol Bay's average run of 37.5 million fish produces a whopping 46% of the world's sockeye salmon. This run sustains more than 29,000 fishing trips each year and creates 14,000 commercial and recreational jobs in a salmon fishery that can last indefinitely, as opposed to the 1,000 or so jobs the Canadian mine developers can offer for a couple of decades.

The salmon's incredible migration also sustains people: nearly half of the world's sockeye catch comes from this one region, which is one of the last, great salmon fisheries on Earth. The returning salmon and other ecological resources create some 14,000 full- and part-time jobs, generate about $480 million annually -- and support 4,000-year-old Alaska Native cultures.

Our own EPA found after three years of peer-reviewed research, that such a mine ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, de-watering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in many areas of the bay watershed. In particular, the EPA estimated 22 miles of streams and more than 6 square miles of wetlands and other habitats that are important to salmon and other fish would be lost to a large-scale mine FOREVER.

Today I urge President Trump to listen to our fishermen and businesses before removing science-based environmental rules that protect Bristol Bay. The future of Bristol Bay must be determined by science, not politics or the whining of Tom Collier, who is only pursuing this mine for the benefit of his company.

Sincerely,

Please prohibit the storage and/or disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. The Bristol Bay 2017 harvest of all salmon species was 39.8 million fish; ranking second over the last 20 years (1997-2016) and worth a preliminary ex-vessel value of $214.6 million almost double the 20-year average of $108.9 million and ranks second during that time frame , as reported by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game Division of Commercial Fisheries.
 
Mines come and go, but leave waste behind from the processing of ore, which under current methods is stored on-site for centuries,. Bristol Bay, like the rest of Alaska, is an earthquake heavy region making it almost certain that storage of tailings (toxic semi-liquid mine waste) will fail. In Bristol bay, these tailings  would mostly be classifieid as Acid Mine Drainage due to oxidation of unearthed pyrite, or ""fool's gold"" which is often found in conjunction with valuable metals. As the name suggests, this waste make water acidic and inhospitable to animal and plant life, while also promoting the growth of acid-producing bacteria that hinder recovery efforts.
 
Alaska's state government notes on its website that it has more earthquakes than any other region of the United States and is, in fact, one of the most seismically active areas of the world, having 11 percent of the planet's earthquakes. Of earthquakes capable of damaging structures, Alaska annually averages
One magnitude 7 to 8 earthquake every year
Six magnitude 6 to 7 earthquakes per year
Forty five magnitude 5 to 6 earthquakes per year
A spill or leakage occurring would be a question not of ""if"", but ""when"".
Bristol Bay  has been called  the  ""Salmon factory of the world"", offers five species of Salmon: King, Sockeye, Chum, Pink and Silver Salmon along with 7 species of freshwater fish: Rainbow Trout, Arctic Char, Arctic Grayling, Dolly Varden, Lake Trout and Northern Pike. Many families rely on the wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical (much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats) and poses its own environmental risks. I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery. The short-term gains of mining projects in the area outweighed by the long term risk to the environment and the economy. Please continue to ensure the wellbeing of this vital waterway by enforcing the EPA region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination.""

The Bristol Bay watershed is uniquely valuable in its pristine state because it supports one of the world's most productive salmon fisheries. 

A 2012 report prepared for the USEPA identified that this watershed has unparalleled ""cultural, subsistence, commercial, recreational, economic, and environmental"" importance; and these these characteristics of the watershed, combined with the size of the proposed Pebble Mine, indicate that ""Pebble poses a greater threat to the environment or fishery"" than other mines (Levit and Chambers 2012, COMPARISON of the PEBBLE MINE with OTHER ALASKA LARGE HARD ROCK MINES). Moreover, in the 2014 Proposed Determination, the USEPA found that the discharge of dredge or fill material into waters of the Bristol Bay Watershed ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, fragmentation, and dewatering of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources. In addition, water withdrawal and capture, storage, treatment, and release of wastewater associated with the mine would significantly impair the fish habitat functions of other streams, wetlands, and aquatic resources.""

As a professional freshwater ecologist, I am concerned that withdrawing this proposed determination and allowing the Pebble Mine project to move forward would result in irreparable damage to the watershed of Bristol Bay, which has both intrinsic natural value, and is irreplaceable as one of the world's most productive salmon fisheries. The short term economic gains from the Pebble Mine project can never substitute for the loss of one of the healthiest salmon watersheds in the world.

I am writing to voice my opposition to the withdrawal of the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination and Clean Water Act protections for the Bristol Bay Watershed.  This is one of the last, if not the last, healthy salmon fisheries in the world.  It is a resource that provides over 14000 + jobs and millions of dollars annually to the world economy.  This watershed is responsible for nearly half of the worlds sockeye salmon.

If this place is destroyed by mining, it will never recover.  It is imperative that we protect this natural resource in a sustainable way that will not only provide jobs and resources now, but for generations to come. One of the reasons that makes our nation so great is that we have come together as a people to protect national treasures such as this. This is a time that we need to take action to preserve unique and fragile ecosystems such as the Bristol Bay watershed.

Thank you,
Todd Byers

My name is Ivan Kuletz, and I am opposed to the development of the proposed Pebble Mine and any other such development in the greater Bristol Bay watershed. I am opposed on ecological, economic, sociological, ethical, and personal grounds. Additionally, I find the rhetoric and arguments of the pro-Pebble group to be unconvincing and more than a little disingenuous.

Bristol Bay is a superlative fishing ground not only for Alaska or the United States, but for the world. Saying ""there are other fisheries"" is like saying ""there are other Mount Everests;"" if the fishery were lost, it could not be replaced, replicated, or substituted. Independent, rigorous assessments from all corners have shown that the Pebble Mine and other such developments represent a danger of such magnitude that when something goes wrong with any mining development in the area, the resulting effects would cripple or kill the Bristol Bay commercial salmon fishery.

The design of the Pebble development and other proposals guarantees a catastrophic failure sometime within the next few hundred years, if not the first few decades after implementation. Given that the tailings, waters, and sediment would have to be kept and monitored into perpetuity due to the persistent toxicity of its contents, this guarantees that a catastrophe is not ""if"" but ""when."" When it does happen, the mine's position at the headwaters of the Nushagak, Naknek, and Kvichak watersheds - which account for over 50% of Bristol Bay's salmon runs every year - would be devastated.

This fishery supports not only the region's economy and beyond, but does so in a far more egalitarian way than the handful of jobs that would be supported by any mining operation. Money from the commercial fishery is dispersed among thousands of families and small businesses both within Bristol Bay and across the state and nation, rather than consolidated in the hands of a few distant stakeholders. The ""economic development of Bristol Bay"" argument is disingenuous and fleeting - the effects of this short-sighted development for vast corporate profits is permanent and unconscionable. Every ADF&G employee knows this, but is effectively gagged from speaking their mind, so it is up to others to do it for them.

Ultimately, this decision cannot ethically be made with monetary profits for this generation in mind, or indeed even five generations distant. This decision must be made with the needs of every generation to come forefront in our minds - that's what sustainability is at its heart. If Pebble Mine goes through, somewhere down the line there will be a generation that pays for the greed of this one. They will be the first to do so, but they won't be the last. Ask yourselves what sort of world you want to leave for all our future generations: do you want to leave Everest for others to climb, or do you want to level it for quick profit?

As you know, Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs. 

Also, mining will destroy what we've protected for generations, do not let greed and hate for your fellow citizens and environmental concerns (we know it's there) allow this site to be devistated.

He apparently acts from a place of knee-jerk reactionism, based on lots of ""dark money"" and ridiculous political biases, without any regard for what EPA is supposed to be about.

Woodward,,,False,EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369-0001,,,2017-10-16T04:00Z,2017-10-16T04:00Z,,,,,,,,Public Comment,,,,,,1.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I write to respectfully request that the EPA not withdraw the Proposed Determination to Restrict Use of Area as Disposal Site: Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska.  
My family and I watched the 2014 Disney movie ""Bears,"" which not only highlighted the bears' migration but also Alaska's salmon runs.  The area in question is one of the most valuable fisheries in the world, and salmon is a valuable part of the human (and bear) diet, providing Omega 3 oils that can help people maintain a healthy heart.  We Americans should be proud to have Bristol Bay as such as valuable natural resource and strive to preserve it for all current and future generations.  Imagine the day when we walk into a grocery store or a fish market, and we can no longer find freshwater sockeye salmon.  Imagine if a mining company caused this disappearance no matter how carefully the company tried to preserve the environment and the local ecosystems through its mining practices.
Alaska is often called America's last great frontier.  Development is a necessary part of human life as our population grows and needs to create areas to live.  But let's do what we can to preserve those ""crown jewels"" in our country and not do something irreversible that we may all regret later.  Yes, development and mining may seem more profitable now for the company and the local economy.  But what are the long-term profits versus the value of keeping Bristol Bay as the most valuable fishery in the world?  This salmon fishery positively impacts the local economy and sustains a way of life for Native Alaskans.  It may positively impact each of us, too, every time we eat sockeye salmon that may come from the region.  Let's keep America great by recognizing the value of this area as a great natural resource for our country's current and future generations.
Many thanks for considering my comments.  I appreciate this opportunity and hope to visit this part of Alaska one day! :)

Sincerely,
Philip Woodward

Whereas mining is necessary to produce elements for modern life, doing so in the Bristol Bay watershed places an unacceptable risk of contamination of a substantial food ecosystem based on the prolific salmon fishery.  It is well established that the mining of deposits like the Pebble deposit expose vast quantities of rock at the Earth's surface that include non-commercial concentrations of copper, gold, and molybdenum as well as a host of additional trace metals, subjecting them to surface weathering that leaches these elements from the rock and introduces them into the surface water system.  It is well established that some of these trace elements are toxic to ecosystems.

The risk of contaminating the Bristol Bay salmon ecosystem, a process that extends all the way up into the human food chain, far outweighs the benefits of mining in this location because toxicity develops for some elements in such low concentrations.  The Clean Water Act mandates that these types of pollution effects be weighed, and the balance of evidence indicates that the risk of contamination of a vibrant salmon food ecosystem is to great to allow mining in this location.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

As a fisheries biologist and an avid salmon fisherman, I do not agree that a mining company should be allowed to mine nor dispose of mining waste in the Bristol Bay watershed. History shows us what mining does to the local environment and valuable fish populations. It is imperative to consider the monetary and emotional costs of the local community's recreational and commercial fisheries compared with the profit of the mining venture. The long term value of recreational and commercial salmon fisheries in Bristol Bay, Alaska most likely trump the short term profitability of a mining venture. 

Monetary and emotional values are among the most important issues the argument against the opening of mining permits in Bristol Bay. The health risks on the local human and wildlife communities and water quality degradation associated with mining waste should also be considered. No matter the manner in which these assessments are carried out, they should be done in the most calculated and scientific way possible, free of partisan politics, with the most weight put on the long term health of the local community, both financially and emotionally. I am all for economic development, but I do not think that the mining of Bristol Bay is the right way to do it. Please do not open the bay up for mining permits. 

Thank you.

Brian Galvez

I am writing to request that the EPA NOT withdraw its July 2014 Clean Water Act 404(c) Proposed Determination.  As someone who has followed this controversy since 2011, it is disheartening to see the EPA attempt to move backward on a great stride it made with that Proposed Determination.  Reviews of mining activity and the maintenance of toxic mine waste, leachates, wastewater, and tailings dams show that such maintenance cannot actually be done ""in perpetuity.""  The best and most recent example comes from Imperial Metals Corporation's Mount Polley copper-gold mine tailings dam, which failed in August 2014, despite being constructed using the best technology of its time.  The Pebble Mine's tailings dam was proposed with the same technology and is in a less stable and more chemically active area, making a failure of this dam even more likely.  The assurance that the Pebble Mine tailings could be feasible maintained in perpetuity is one of the underpinnings of the entire proposal.  Because of the likelihood of a failure, Pebble Mine's proposal is not in the best interest of the area.  There is no question that, if a failure occurred, it would devastate a world-renowned fishery of national and global importance.  It would devastate a sustainable fishery consisting of many stakeholders ranging from small individual operations to larger businesses.Thus, given that a failure in the Pebble Mine's tailings dam is quite feasible, it is of the utmost importance for the EPA not to withdraw its July 2014 Proposed Determination, as this was written with the best available science and information.  It does not make sense for our country to trade such a valuable, renewable resource for one that is not renewable.  As a fisheries professional, people like myself look to such pristine fisheries and habitats as we attempt to responsibly manage the fisheries in the rest of our country, many of which are in poor shape and in need of recovery.  Thank you again for your consideration.

I fully support the new proposed mine design and scale. The mine will be highly beneficial to the region in both economic and environmental aspects. 
 
The EPA must withdraw the Proposed Determination to remedy EPA's prior overreach. This was extremely unlawful and set a precedent for future proposals to be thrown away for reasons that couldn't be rebutted. You cannot pre-reject a proposal if you DO NOT provide methods for gaining compliance even on the most granular scale. 

In late 2016 and 2017 the PLP has gone to extraordinary lengths to ensure the habitat will be minimally impacted. Enormous amounts of money have been spent to ensure all aspect of the project and future mine are thoroughly thought through. 

The EPA rooted by and Policy should be and needs to be rooted in objective fact and where available scientific support. 

This is why I believe the PLP must be given a pathway to permitting. Withdrawal of the Proposed Determination will not harm the environment; it only allows PLP to engage in the normal permitting process.

Please give PLP the legal right to enter the permitting process.

I am writing in response to the decision to withdraw the 2014 Clean Water act ruling protecting Bristol Bay Alaska tributaries from the deposit of Pebble Mine waste tailings. I am a PhD student from Tennessee studying Pacific salmon conservation at the University of British Columbia. I work on the Fraser River in Canada, the largest sockeye salmon producing river in Canada. Salmon populations in British Columbia and the lower 48 states are declining alarmingly, and this is projected to worsen in the future, especially as ocean and river temperatures rise. 

The more salmon research I do, the more I see that salmon have extremely important cultural importance to people of all walks of life in Alaska and elsewhere. In addition to cultural attachment, healthy salmon runs provide a healthy food source to people around the world, a livelihood for commercial fishermen, a social backbone for native people, and a bonding source of entertainment for recreational fishermen. The sockeye fishery in Bristol Bay alone has been valued at 1.5 billion dollars, a renewable resource that will grow even more valuable if properly managed while the rest of the world's fisheries decline. The continued existence of healthy populations of these and other salmonids is priceless compared to the mineral deposits sought after by the Pebble Mine. While these minerals are important, it would be extremely reckless to sacrifice the wellbeing of one of the most important fisheries in the world in order to dump mine tailings in a pristine environment. Please do a service to the world and act as you should - a steward of the agency to PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT.

This in a unique topic in which Alaskans of diverse backgrounds ( fisherman, environmentalists, business leaders, hunters, native corporations) have come together and agreed.  Pebble mine's potential risk to the Alaska Salmon Industry is too great.  Alaskans oppose the pebble mine and we expect the EPA to uphold its duty in protecting our environment.

The Bristol Bay watershed is one of the most important areas for Sockeye Salmon. This sustainable industry generates approximately 1.5 BILLION dollars annually. The Salmon industry supports 14,000 jobs, fueling jobs in tourism, sport fishing, and commercial fishing. This area is also culturally important to the native Alaskan people.

How can you even consider wiping out a sustainable industry that brings 1.5 billion dollars of revenue to Alaskans for a mine that will only operate for relatively few years. The Pebble Mine will wipe out this sustainable fishing resource and it will never come back. This move is short-sighted and only focused on bringing profit to the mining industry.

I am against the EPA's proposal to rescind the 2014 proposed regulation. As a life-long resident of Alaska, I know that Alaskans - from the late Alaska Senator Ted Stevens to current Governor Bill Walker - consider salmon the highest and best use of the Bristol Bay watershed. I support the Obama Admin. 2014 decision to restrict the use of this area as a disposal site for the proposed Pebble Mine. Even though the Pebble partnership recently proposed a mine smaller than the overwhelmingly huge original plan, this would still be an extremely large mine, disrupting large acreages and the waters that flow through them. Tampering with the pristine habitat that supports one of the greatest salmon resources and fisheries in the world is a radical and unacceptable idea.

The Bristol Bay watershed supports about half of the world's sockeye salmon. Resilience of the area's sockeye population is high due to the pristine habitat and the high genetic diversity of the many smaller stocks that make up in this great population. History conclusively shows that salmon on this scale, or even on much smaller scale, do not persist in the midst of human molestation of the watersheds. This is particularly true of the mining proposed here.

Large earth-filled dams are planned for this development even though smaller such dams have failed recently in British Columbia.  The ancillary development required for very large mines - water withdrawals, impoundments and releases, ore storage and treatments, transportation corridors, industrial facilities, worker facilities, etc. - would all add up to a huge impact on this area. The water quality needed by fish is higher than that for human consumption. 

Minerals are a non-renewable resource. The salmon of this area have renewed themselves for thousands of years. The tradition of fishing them is embedded in the culture of Southwest Alaska, and of Alaska in general. DON'T MESS WITH OUR SALMON!

I urge you not to withdraw EPAs Proposed Determination To Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska. EPAs decision is based on rigorous science, which clearly demonstrates that the Pebble mine will likely cause irreparable damage to the Bristol Bay ecosystem. For the sake of preserving native cultural heritage, maintaining secure jobs for thousands of people, and preserving a unique ecosystem for our children and future generations, I am vehemently opposed to allow a company to destroy this ecosystem.  The potential profits gained by the project are dwarfed by the exponential and long-term costs to the unique natural and cultural features of the project area and Bristol Bay. Yes, the ecosystem is of global importance, but that doesnt mean it is available for exploitation by foreign investors.
 
Please remember that you represent the people of the United States of America and not foreign companies.  The majority of Bristol Bays and Alaskas citizens are against the Pebble mine. The people and science have spoken, and as their representative, their collective voice must be reflected in your decision!

Respectfully,

While I am not specifically a fisheries biologist, I am a wildlife biologist and I understand specifically what impacts an open-pit mine will have on the Bristol Bay ecosystem. I understand that salmon link the marine and terrestrial ecosystems and serve as the basis of the food web. I understand that salmon serve as a sustainable resource that is both an economically valuable contributor to the state of Alaska (in the form of jobs fisherfolks, processors, marine suppliers, boat mechanics, among others), but also provides a bigger and health-important resource for people all over the world that buy and consume fresh, wild, salmon. Not only that, sockeye salmon in the Bristol Bay area is a well managed fishery and an example of what is possible when science and management are combined for the welfare of both people and fish stocks. Bristol Bay also supports a successful salmon sport fishery where people pay thousands of dollars for the experience of fishing in this unique and pristine place, and a lot of that is invested in the communities around the bay, and the state of Alaska. Not only that, but salmon in Bristol Bay are a priceless and integral piece of Native Alaskan culture, spirituality, and subsistence practices. The loss of or damage to wild salmon in the area would be the same as the loss of or acute damage to an entire way of being. Further, the down sides of open pit mines are well documented operation is temporary and unsustainable; the mine and tailings often far outlast the profit or even the mining company itself, overrun and devastate local waterways and ecosystems, and companies often leave the damage for local communities to live with and clean up (e.g. Berkeley Pit mine in Butte, Montana). These effects can last hundreds of years. In my mind, it is clear that no amount of profit, particularly for a foreign company, justifies the risk of damaging salmon populations in Bristol Bay.

I'd like to add my voice to those opposed to the proposed withdrawal of your previous Proposed Determination to Restrict Use of Area as Disposal Site: Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska. I was born in Anchorage in 1984 and grew up in Homer, Alaska. I graduated as a Homer High Mariner in May 2002. My parents were teachers, and in the summer, my dad commercial fished for salmon in the Cook Inlet. Later my sister would join him stacking corks, and I would work the slime line at Coal Point Seafood. Like most Alaskans on the coast, salmon were a large part of our lives. We ate them and made money from them.

I'd briefly work for the Park Service at Lake Clark doing radio telemetry studies with whitefish, sampling pike, and counting sockeye. Lake Clark is the same vicinity of the state that this proposed mine is in. We spoke to geologists about the pH levels of the material that would be held in Pebble's proposed tailing ponds. The implications with a spill of material with pH levels that high are enormous.

In college, I would begin working at salmon hatcheries around the state, staring in the Prince William Sound at Wally Norenburg Hatchery and then Armin F. Koernig Hatchery. I would move to Southeast and work at Macaulay Hatchery operated by DIPAC and Hidden Falls Hatchery operated by NSRAA. Eventually I would work my way into a fish culturist position in charge of the chinook and experimental saltwater coho programs. My experience has amounted to great understanding of the importance of salmon to this state. We spend millions each year at one private non-profit to raise salmon. 

Bristol Bay is the largest wild (not hatchery originated) salmon run in the world. We cannot replace that run if it is lost. The tools we have at hatcheries don't amount to what nature has created there. Please do not withdraw your Proposed Determination. Pebble would provide some jobs, but the risks to more livelihoods, lifestyles, and a way of life is much much greater. 

Alaskans love to sentimentalize that we are made of salmon, but in a lot of ways they're right. My dad's commercial fishing check bought me school clothes and mine bought me my first car; we've eaten it for school night dinners, barbecues, my sister's wedding, and Christmas dinner; and I've made salmon - spawned them for hours upon hours, days upon days. It is the EPA's job to restrict use to activities that jeopardize the health of our water, and this determination should stand to do just that.

Thank you for your consideration,

As a freshwater ecologist, I study how streams and rivers function as essential habitats for a wide range of aquatic species. I spent two years at the Pebble mine assisting with the baseline studies to go through the permitting process in 2012 and 2013. During this time, I saw an incredible area full of intact stream and river systems that not only support the largest populations of sockeye salmon in the world but also a myriad of anadromous and freshwater resident fish species. This area is the most pristine area I've ever been and not only does it support critical habitat for a range of species (both aquatic and terrestrial), but it also provides food and jobs for the local Alaskan natives and fisherman in Bristol Bay. I cannot think of a worse place to put an open pit mine. I highly, highly recommend against it. 

Case in point: We worked on hydrology study mapping the presence and distribution of off-channel habitats available for rearing juvenile lifestages of salmon around the proposed mine site. This work was repeated at different flows during the summer. At the end of the summer as the August rains arrived, the area where the proposed mine would take place became absolutely saturated. Water was everywhere. This landscape thrives on connectivity and at this time of year everything is connected. If this mine were ever to be built and a spill from a tailings dam occurs, there would be no way to contain the spill. And because the proposed mine site is situated at the headwaters of the two most productive salmon bearing rivers in the Bristol Bay watershed, it would inevitably spread downstream. 

I am not against mining and do see the benefits of mining taking place domestically under more stringent environmental regulations. However, this is the wrong place for a project like this to take place. The Bristol Bay watershed should be set aside as a protected area to allow one of the last intact ecosystems left in the world to thrive on its own.

Withdrawing the proposed determination would ignore the overwhelming majority of Alaskans. The economic, cultural, and environmental significance of the great sustainable Bristol Bay salmon runs to the region is immeasurable.

The risk of such a large open pit ore mine in a pristine ecosystem is certainly too great. No matter what the company proclaims, they honestly can't state - nor prove - they will not have a tailings dam failure now and in years to come, or other environmental issues that will cause great harm. I have zero trust the company would be there to provide adequate and actual recompensation to those that rely of the world's greatest salmon fishery for generations to come. I ask you what legal requirements would be put in place to cover economic losses for generations to come. And what of the loss of biodiversity that is irreplaceable. It is the world's largest salmon fisheries, and should be protected above all else. Salmon is food, a way of life, and a keystone species. 

One just needs to look at the great promises and failures of Canada's Mount Polley mine. The dam breach created tremendous economic and environmental consequences. Do not allow the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of long term American jobs and long standing cultural way of life.

Perhaps it takes a lower 48 PNW resident to fully grasp all that was lost with that regions salmon fisheries, to realize what is left needs to be fiercely protected. Billions of taxpayer dollars have been spent on salmon restoration efforts in the United States but few success stories have emerged. It is far less costly to us all to protect precious healthy salmon runs now then try and repair and restore afterward. 

Any new Pebble Mine EIS should be required to have a full environmental accounting - from a price of all ecosystem services of a healthy intact environment to loss of wages and full cost of recovery after any environmental impacts which are bound to happen eventually.

I thank all the dedicated EPA staff who worked on this issue for three years and with twice peer reviewed science determined - Wrong mine. Wrong Place. Large open pit mines should not be put in sensitive watersheds, and certainly have no place at all in the most productive salmon nursery grounds. Salmon is one of the healthiest sources of protein we have. I eat wild salmon only. Leave the wild rivers be.

A toxic mine in the middle of one of our nations greatest food-producing regions would not make America great again.

I have spent four summers in the wilderness of the Bristol Bay watershed. Having conducted research around the globe, including Antarctica, I can say that the Bristol Bay area remains one of the most astounding natural places on this planet. Without seeing it first hand, I think it is impossible to imagine the millions of salmon migrating up river, filling lakes, transforming the entire ecosystem with their red, nutrient-rich bodies. Bears, eagles, gulls, trout all congregate to feast on the salmon riches. This is a scene not repeated elsewhere on the planet at the same scale. 

This is all possible because of the pristine watersheds of the Bristol Bay region. My own research has shown how vital it is to have diverse, wild freshwater habitat available for sockeye salmon (Schindler, D. E., Hilborn, R., Chasco, B., Boatright, C. P., Quinn, T. P., Rogers, L. A., & Webster, M. S. (2010). Population diversity and the portfolio effect in an exploited species. Nature, 465(7298), 609-612.). This is not only about preserving nature for nature's sake, but also for the native communities that depend on fishing (and have for centuries), and for the millions of other world citizens who consume wild salmon as a healthy, renewable source of protein. If not wild salmon, then what? Should we import frozen fish from Asia? Or should we rather continue to utilize our own renewable natural resources to their fullest? This ecosystem makes food for us for free. 

A mine like Pebble would impact this ecosystem, and all of its services to humans, not just for a few years or decades, but forever. The EPA undertook a rigorous scientific study of the Bristol Bay watershed, finding that the risk to these sensitive habitats from a mine was too great. Why risk our nation's food security, job security, natural resources, and greatness for the interests of a private mining company (that isn't even American)?

Your agency's findings already demonstrated that building a mine of this scale in this location would be an unacceptably destructive venture. I urge you keep in place the July 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination - for the sake of the Bristol Bay watershed, its world-class salmon fishery, its people, and all of humanity.

The EPA decision regarding the Pebble Mine should stand!   Alaska depends on its fishery jobs and the salmon resources of our state's waters. Do not withdraw the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination, which was made under our Clean Water Act.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's and the world's last great wild salmon runs. The annual runs of millions of salmon, support a large number of commercial and sport fishing jobs that keep thousands of Americans and Alaskans employed.  For Alaskans they are an important subsistence resource, for indigenous cultures salmon is a keystone, and for visitors from all over who come to Alaska, it is an amazing experience to still be able to catch salmon.

These are jobs fueled by an important renewable, valuable food resource. We should not risk this resource that can endure into the future to a foreign-owned mining company.  The people of Alaska, roughly 65%, do not support the proposed Pebble Mine.  We support our present and future by taking care of our salmon.

The EPA has done the right thing by making a decision protects Bristol Bay.  This was not an arbitrary decision. They followed the rigorous procedures for public comment, participation, and hearings.  The public responded with over a million and a half responses on this topic.

Please listen to the Alaskans and our fellow citizens in other states who support the EPA decision.

Please do not withdraw the proposed determination.

According to an exhaustive, peer-reviewed study undertaken by EPA itself - reportedly at the request of multiple inquiries, concerns, and petitions to EPA - ""the extraction, storage, treatment, and transportation activities associated with building, operating, and maintaining one of the largest mines ever built would pose significant risks to the unparalleled ecosystem that produces one of the greatest wild salmon fisheries left in the world. In simple terms, the infrastructure necessary to mine the Pebble deposit jeopardizes the longterm health and sustainability of the Bristol Bay ecosystem"".

Regardless of the specifics of permit applications that Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP) may submit to permit mining activities in the Pebble deposit, the EPA's own peer-reviewed scientific analysis has already determined that the infrastructure necessary to mine that deposit jeopardizes the long-term health and sustainability of the Bristol Bay ecosystem. There cannot possibly be a clearer reason to let the July 2014 Proposed Determination stand.

We Alaskans rely on RENEWABLE resources to ensure an economic vitality not just today, but for our future generations. No matter how you feel, you cannot ignore the fact that mines are NOT RENEWABLE, and they pollute the watersheds around them. I support renewable fisheries in Bristol Bay, have many friends that make a living from this area, and do not want to see that resource jeopardized by a mine. A mine will always run dry and jobs will run out. Our fisheries resources, managed well, will not. It's quite simple. I do not want even a POSSIBILITY that something could go wrong and affect this watershed and there is NO WAY to be sure the Pebble Mine wouldn't harm our environment.

I am writing to you and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to not withdraw or rescind the Proposed Determination for Docket EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369-0001.

By allowing PLP to apply for permits for further exploration and development, I question the EPA's commitment to fulfilling and adhering to the Clean Water Act. Further, there are no roads connecting the proposed mine site and it is only accessible by air. Transportation of any materials would need to be exported using a deep-water port and transportation network. The construction of this road, deep-water port and transportation network will displace billions of metric tons of rock and waste both near shore and very deep below surface waters. This will have outstanding negative impacts such as pollution, and further degradation to coastal and wetland areas that are crucial for wildlife, recreational and fishing uses, and traditional way of life to the Alaska Native communities in the area. 

The Bristol Bay watershed is largely undisturbed and Pebble mine is in the headwaters of major tributaries. Approximately 7,500 people live within or near the area downstream of Pebble and a substantial portion of the population rely on access to wild resources and subsistence. Tourism and sport fishing are major industries that bring thousands of people in each year to partake in renowned trout and salmon fishing. 

Pebble is a proposed open pit mine with an estimated 20 to 25-year lifespan. PLP claim that the mine would generate an estimated 2,000 jobs for construction, 1,000 full-time operational jobs and could generate tax revenue for the state. However, these jobs are only temporary and will dissipate once the mine is fully exhausted. In many cases, an influx of job opportunities in the area will also require further services to accommodate said workers. This can negatively affect infrastructure, sustainable resource management and socio-economic dynamics of surrounding Alaska Native communities. Alternatively, it is estimated that the Bristol Bay watershed generates $480 million and provides employment for over 14,000 part-time and full-time workers each year. Therefore, I argue that the preservation and protection of this area far outweighs the short-term influx of jobs. 

As mentioned previously, the Bristol Bay watershed is a highly-productive ecosystem. However, mine construction and operations could have devastating impacts to the water. For instance, wastewater treatment plant discharges could enter surrounding streams that are critical fish habitat. Transportation or pipeline failures will have adverse impacts to the watershed. Additionally, tailings ponds and storage facilities can fail, causing leachates and other chemical waste to enter the ecosystem and cause major health issues to downstream populations of both wildlife and humans. Impacts to water quality and fish habitat could heavily impact regional subsistence users and Alaska Native culture. 

Further, the Bristol Bay watershed provides habitat for 29 fish species, 40 terrestrial mammals, and over 190 bird species. Sockeye salmon are the most prevalent fish species and the runs support an estimated 46% of the global average abundance of wild sockeye salmon. Watershed quality, hydrologic connectivity and the diversity of the aquatic habitat, all of which enable the system to be highly productive, could be adversely impacted. It is estimated that the mine would cause between 30 to 145 km of stream to be altered or even destroyed due to mine construction, waste rock piles, blockage or dewatering. Other impacts include, but are not limited to; wetland destruction, imbalance of surface and groundwater flows, or loss of organic materials - all of which are necessary for fish production. 

Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act authorizes the EPA to protect streams and rivers important for critical fish spawning grounds and wildlife habitat. The 2011 EPA Bristol Bay watershed assessment evaluated the effects of Pebble mine on the surrounding ecosystem. The assessment revealed that the proposed mining-activity would indeed cause adverse impacts to important fish habitat. If this is the case, then why is the EPA still considering the project? PLP has stated that the EPA had used outdated mine modelling and was very inaccurate in terms of projected impacts of the mine. I argue that if this is true, then further assessment is required to make the best decision using the best available science.
 
In summary, I urge you and the EPA to stand by its initial decision that was issued pursuant of the Clean Water Act. The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and work towards continued protection of the Bristol Bay watershed. 

Sincerely, 

Karli T. Hassell

I am shocked that there is now a proposal to reverse the 2014 Proposed Determination to restrict mining in the Bristol Bay watershed.  We have only one planet, and we must protect what we have left of it.  To allow mining, owned by a foreign company, with limited benefit, if any, to the United States, and with every potential for harm to both our fisheries and our U.S. environment, would be a mistake.  The EPA should be furthering policies to improve our environment, not harm it.  I find no reason to reverse the previous decision, and am very concerned about the impartiality of administrator Pruitt.

Please do not remove the protections on the Bristol Bay watershed. I am a fisherman's wife in small town Alaska and I see the value of a healthy, well-maintained, sustainable fishery, both for my community and for the world which consumes healthy, wild salmon. The protections afforded Bristol Bay were created after extensive research by your Environmental Protection Agency. To remove them would be a disservice to that work they did, but more importantly it would threaten a habitat that has thrived for thousands of years. To remove them for the profit of few at the cost of many would be short-sighted. Please stay the protections.

I am opposed to EPAs proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

The 2014 action by the EPA to restrict the dumping of mine tailings in the Upper Talarik Creek, North Fork Koktuli River and South Fork Koktuli River watersheds was a sound decision based on a reasonable assessment of the risk associated with projects of this scope. This region of Alaska supports a financially and environmentally healthy wild salmon fishery. The EPA's 2014 action is a practical step that protects the rivers and lakes that salmon need for spawning and rearing.

I do not support the ""withdrawal"" now proposed by the EPA and do not understand any rationale for doing so. Please do not change course. Instead, please honor the 2014 action that promises to protect salmon waters because a salmon system of this quality and scale simply exists no place else on Earth. 

As the holder of an Alaska limited entry permit for the Bristol Bay salmon fishery, I and my business associates understand the value of the abundant salmon runs and cannot support an experiment with large-scale mining in the Bristol Bay headwaters. These salmon runs have been a valuable industrial asset to this state and this nation for more than 125 years. So long as we continue to protect the salmon streams and lakes, and the lands surrounding them, these salmon runs will continue to thrive and continue to feed a thriving industry for generations to come.

The Bristol Bay sockeye salmon run is the largest wild sockeye salmon

After many years of careful study, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) found that the proposed Pebble Mine would have devastating
impacts on the region's salmon. I am alarmed at EPA's recent decision
to reverse course and allow a proposal for the massive mine to move
forward. The proposed mine, and the accompanying mining district it
could facilitate, would damage the people and wildlife of Bristol Bay,
threaten Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, and undermine America's
wild heritage.
The remarkable economic, community and cultural values of the wild
salmon fishery are essential to Bristol Bay and Lake Clark National

protect Bristol Bay's economy, people and wildlife. Please do not allow

I strongly object to EPA head Scott Pruitt's decision to withdraw the Obama protections for Bristol Bay for the benefit of Pebble Limited Partnership (Dynasty Minerals -- a Canadian mining company). The EPA must not withdraw its protections for the largest sustainable salmon run on Earth (56 million annually), thousands of American fishing jobs, clean water (a human right), and rights of the indigenous people who have honored & lived on the salmon runs for thousands of years. 

The EPA has already conducted an extensive review about the disastrous nature of this project: ""a larger-scale mine would result in the ""complete loss"" of salmon habitat in some areas of the watershed."" Furthermore, experts like University of Washington Fisheries Professor Ray Hillborn have stated ""The idea you could store highly toxic waste (from a mine) forever behind a dam is just ridiculous"" as he notes that the very reason the area is so productive for salmon (gravel beds) means it's very difficult to keep out mining toxins.  

I do not see why Tom Collier (foreign Pebble CEO)'s secret meeting with Mr. Pruitt gives him the right to exploit one of the United States' greatest renewable resources. Why should a renewable, sustainable resource that belongs to Americans be exploited for foreign profit, so Pebble can construct the ""largest open pit mine ever constructed in North America... cover an area the size of Manhattan... a pit as 80% as deep as Grand Canyon.""

Please do not withdraw the protections for Bristol Bay! As a Washingtonian, I purchase wild-caught Alaska salmon all the time. It is a beautiful, amazing resource and I love visiting beautiful, unique Alaska.

Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.

We are a richer nation when we take care of our natural resources. Trump would allow mining in the middle of the Grand Canyon if he thought he could profit from it.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Hello EPA Administrator,
My Name is Eugene Maltzeff, I have been commercial fishing in Bristol Bay for 46 years. I also have two other businesses that sell and promote Bristol Bay salmon. 
I have been able to raise my family from an economy derived from the pure waters of Bristol Bay region. I also plan on passing this amazing fishing culture on to my children. 
Purity of water is the fundamental attribute of the BB region and Sockeye Fishery. We as fisherman, seafood processors, sportsman and sport lodge owners. All base our business, our lives, on the knowledge that the water quality in Bristol Bay remains pure.   
The fundamental reason the area is so environmentally and economically healthy, is based on the mere fact, that the watersheds are pure and support abundant life.  
These natural systems work perfectly, as they have for thousands of years.
There are no stores, gas stations, parking lots, industries, vehicles that lead historically to the demise of wild salmon, from toxic runoff and groundwater pollution. We also know, evidenced by endless example, that mines are always toxic, cannot coexist with salmon habitat. 
The notion, that this PPL mine will be more advanced in mitigating pollution is just rhetoric and a calamity waiting to happen. It takes very little heavy metal, like trace copper, to disorient young salmon and now there is good evidence, that run off from city streets by auto brake, copper residue, is killing young and adult salmon.
The concept of permitting anyone to tamper with this priceless watershed, must always be forbidden. The very fact that this economy has served and fed humans for thousands of years must be preserved at all cost. There, is no room for even small mistakes to be made! Especially when it comes to polluting critical headwaters that are already situated in a recognized earthquake zone.    
Conclusion: Proposed Determination that was issued pursuant of the Clean Water Act, to restrict the use of certain waters in the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds in southwest Alaska as disposal sites for dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit, a copper-, gold-, and molybdenum-bearing ore body. 
The Proposed Determination must remain in effect and must override any entity who feels it should have the right to develop a contaminating industry Such as PPL anywhere in the Bristol Bay region.
Thank you for your time and consideration regarding this matter. 
Sincerely, Gene Maltzeff

I oppose this plan which basically puts the interests of a foreign mining company above those of two-thirds of Alaskans, 80% of Bristol Bay residents and indigenous communities, and 85% of commercial fishermen.

The EPA has previously determined that the planned pebble mine would cause great damage to the unparalleled salmon runs and local fisheries as well as to local Native communities. 

The foreign owned pebble mine would cause significant damage to the world-renowned salmon runs of Bristol Bay. This fishery is worth moth than 1.5 million dollars a year and supports 14,000 jobs. All of this would be put at risk for the interests of a non-American mining company.

 More than 1.5 million Americans have previously submitted public comments opposing this pebble mine.

I am commenting as a concerned citizen who has recently visited the Bristol Bay/Nak Nek River Region. From my personal experience, it is one of the more beautiful and healthy river systems in our country. Withdrawing the regulations currently in place will greatly put this system at risk and will undoubtably disrupt/destroy the ecosystem. In short, I do not approve the withdraw and highly oppose letting mine tailings be dumped in the area for ""safe"" storage. 

If history (Mount Polley) and my disproval are not enough to convince, I suggest you reconsider the economic ramifications in the case these tailings do fail to meet expectations and result in entering the river systems. I understand the dollar trumps and do not let the short term gains, to benefit the few, cloud your decision. I would like you to consider the entire economic system that is currently supported by this river system. For instance, commercial fisheries and tourism (fishing, hunting, bear viewing, eco-toursim). 

Please keep the current regulations in place. Thank you for your time and the consideration of my comments.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must continue to restrict the use of certain waters in the Bristol Bay watershed for disposal of dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit, a large ore body in southwest Alaska because of the high ecological and economic value of the Bristol Bay watershed and the assessed unacceptable environmental effects that would result from such mining. 

Bristol Bay is the greatest wild salmon fisheries left in the world, supplying approximately one half of the world's sockeye salmon. All watershed salmon are wild, there being no hatchery or hatchery releases. These sockeye salmon have a very high genetic diversity in the many separate runs, leading to high resilience. A pristine habitat is another basis of the productivity and diversity.  The original Pebble Mine proposal involved massive mine pits and large tailings impoundments (dammed with earth-filled dams made mostly out of tailings) and waste rock piles. Extraction, storage, treatment and transportation would involve transportation corridors, pipelines, power generation, and support services.  

Our fish resources are one of the most highly valued in the state of Alaska and around the world.  A major mine upstream from the largest spawning salmon watershed in the world is idiotic and irresponsible.  Again and again mines around the world have polluted the water and air around them.  Bristol Bay must stay pristine for the health and livelihood of future generations as well as the food supply for the world.

Please do not reverse the determination that the Pebble Mine poses to too great a risk to the Bristol Bay ecosystem and it's fisheries to be built. I have been a volunteer in my community for over 25 years working to protect and preserve our wild salmon fisheries. This iconic and valuable resource defines our region. It has supported a robust fishing industry (both recreational and commercial), and it is a legacy we Northwesters have worked hard to preserve for our children and grandchildren. 

The proposed construction of this mine is an ecological nightmare and a short-sighted economic mistake. Bristol Bay provides thousands of jobs and millions of dollars annually to the U.S economy; the resource is 100% renewable. These impressive figures do not include great benefits to society from an intact ecosystem and maintenance of a resource with substantial cultural and spiritual importance. Pebble mine may provide short-term economic benefit, but long term this is a foolish mistake from an economic, ecological, social, and historical perspective. 

Construction of this mine risk's the preservation of our world's last great salmon fishery. We cannot risk the loss of something this priceless. Our nation has destroyed nearly every other salmon fishery in the lower 48, and the loss of this great fishery would forever erase a livelihood that has defined the Pacific Northwest since history was first recorded in this region. Please understand the basic economics behind this: Pebble Mine may result in some short-term economic benefit; however, the long-lasting nature of its toxic legacy will inevitably destroy our last renewable salmon fishery, worth hundreds of millions of dollars forever to come. Do not repeat history and do not ignore the long-term economic benefits of protecting Bristol Bay form short-sighted corporate demands. Your children and mine will thank you for having the foresight and ethics to preserve this important legacy for their future.

For me, I learned salmon runs are the true seasonal calendar; not days of the week or months in the year.  Salmon are noble creatures: born to ultimately return to their home streams to reproduce and die.  They create life and sustain life; feeding people, bears, and forests. 
The removal of the protections for Bristol Bay to allow for a ""smaller"" Pebble Mine on this pristine watershed ignores the salmon and its place for Alaskans. 
Worse, it places money and corporate interests -- as realistically with mining the ""jobs"" created are negligible in comparison to the money returns for the investors -- above history, culture, and nature. 

Salmon returns, and anadromous returns in general, continue to decrease.  Bristol Bay, to this point, has continued to have good returns.  But with water temperatures changing and the decreasing numbers in the Taku and Southeast Alaska as a harbinger, protections must be in place to ensure the continued return of these fish.
Reducing protections for the salmon will not ensure the returns of these majestic fish to a special region of Alaska.  

I can only hope, or wish, that others can experience what I have experienced.  I urge Mr. Pruitt to visit Bristol Bay.  I urge him to spend time in the fish camps.  I urge him to fly over the region and see the watershed.  More pointedly, I urge him to catch some sockeye and coho salmon and eat them over a campfire. 
Understanding the environment and what many cannot articulate, may be the best way to show and explain why this area deserves continued protection.  I do not believe an adequate decision can be made without knowing the full scope of the area and experiencing it.

The Bristol Bay watershed is unique because it supports one of the world's most productive salmon fisheries. A 2012 report prepared for the USEPA identified that this watershed has unparalleled ""cultural, subsistence, commercial, recreational, economic, and environmental"" importance; and these characteristics of the watershed, combined with the size of the proposed Pebble Mine, indicate that ""Pebble poses a greater threat to the environment or fishery"" than other mines (Levit and Chambers 2012, COMPARISON of the PEBBLE MINE with OTHER ALASKA LARGE HARD ROCK MINES). 

I am deeply concerned that withdrawing this proposed determination and allowing the Pebble Mine project to move forward would result in irreparable damage to the watershed of Bristol Bay, which has both intrinsic natural value, and is irreplaceable as one of the world's most productive salmon fisheries. The short term economic gains from the Pebble Mine project can never substitute for the loss of one of the healthiest salmon watersheds in the world.

As a resident of Seattle, I have followed the Pebble project for many years.  Needless to say it is a controversial subject 
in this area.
At first it was simply a curiosity to me but as I learned more about what was taking place, 
it felt to me that a real injustice was being dealt to the partnership.  
In an area zoned for mining, this was nothing less than taking away personal property rights without due process and without compensation. 
I have always felt that there
was a process in place for vetting projects and that this was somehow being circumvented.  My suggestion is to let the process
play out as our system is designed.  If the project is as dangerous as its foes believe, it will not get approval.  If it does appear
that the project will gain approval, another option could be to purchase the development rights from Pebble.  The party that
seems to have the most to gain without any skin in the game are the commercial fisherman.  Maybe set up an escrow account
that charges a small $/pound fee for fish caught in Bristol Bay to eventually payoff the buyout expense.  Either way, let the 
process function as it was intended and go from there.
Thank you for your attention.

To whom it may concern,

There is no battle worth fighting more than protecting the Bristol Bay Habitat from the destructive results and bi-products of mining. The fragile ecosystem of this part to the world is valuable for unlimited reasons. Alaskans depend on the healthy fisheries in this area and we demand that the EPA does not make it easier for mining companies to wreck havoc on this valuable fishery. 
 
Be smart for the long term, Protect this Environment, Environmental Protection Agency! Do not withdraw regulations that have present and future generations on the line for the economic gain of mining companies. Fish is the food on the table.

This proposal must be withdrawn unless the Administrator is capable of presenting a substantive rationale for change. 

Environmentally destructive: The long-term potential environmental impacts of the Pebble are not properly regulated and their costs are not properly identified. Proposals such as Pebble Mine are advanced by businesses in the absence of a regulatory structure that identifies the full environmental costs associated with such operations. Financial responsibility requirements authorized under CERCLA section 108(b) have not been promulgated for hard rock mining, so they cannot be imposed to provide funding to cover the response costs and natural resource damages that will inevitably be caused by Pebble mine.  

The result is artificially low costs for mining. This cost distortion removes an incentive for recycling used electronics and other equipment that are dense with gold, copper and other valuable metals --- much denser than the ore deposits at Pebble.  Sufficient incentives and infrastructure for this kind of recycling are not in place, and artificially low costs for virgin materials do not encourage the development of these incentives and infrastructure.

Arbitrary and capricious: There is no evidence that the Administrator considered the decision making record, information from Agency staff, or public views before agreeing to the settlement.   

While the litigation concerning Pebble mine and the 404(c) determination has been settled, this settlement does not authorize EPA to repudiate the 404(c) determination without full consideration of all the factors considered by EPA in making its earlier determination, and a substantive reproposal that addresses the merits.

Hypocritical --- The proposal is particularly idiotic and contemptible in the face of the directive issued yesterday, October 16 2017, by Administrator Pruitt on ""Promoting Transparency and Public Participation In Consent Decrees and Settlements Agreements,"" proclaiming that the days of ""sue and settle"" are over.  This proposal is a ridiculous example of ""sue and settle,"" repudiating years of work and an intensive scientific and public process, reaching an agreement with one set of litigants without reference to the substantive work supporting the 404(c) determination.   Supposedly, ""regulation by litigation"" is no longer acceptable, but ""deregulation by litigation"" continues to blunder recklessly ahead. By law, the Administrator must apply his own pronouncements evenhandedly, however foolish they are.

CorruptThe decision to turn over American resources to poorly regulated foreign enterprises puts global corporate interests ahead of the interests of American citizens.

This year alone, over $300 million dollars was generated in connection to the returning salmon exactly because of its pristine spawning grounds.  This has been happening for thousands of years and could happen far into the future if we have vision and sense enough to just LEAVE THE AREA ALONE!!!!!!!  Humans have screwed up plenty of former salmon spawning grounds.  Let's not do it in Bristol Bay.  It is the best of the best that is left in the entire world.  For the record, I have spent 3 summers in Bristol Bay as a commercial fisherman, Fish & Game employee and private citizen exploring much of the area.  I know exactly what is at stake.  I guarantee you it is far more than could ever be gained from any mine, particularly one as ill-conceived, short sighted and horribly located as Pebble.  Let's do the right thing this time.  Leave Bristol Bay alone.  Thank you.

 what happened to america first?

I am opposed to EPAs proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I wanted to reach out to voice my concerns about the proposed lifting of restrictions on the disposal of material from Pebble Mine into the watersheds of SW Alaska. I grew up in Seattle, WA and have settled down in Portland, OR and despite the proximity to Alaska it was not until after I graduated from college that I made my first trip North. I have since taken several trips to many regions in Alaska to hike, fly fish, and explore. 

One of the regions I have had the opportunity to return to many times in the Bristol Bay, specifically the Naknek River. After my first day on the Naknek I knew it was a place I would be coming back to for the rest of my life. From a day on the river chasing rainbows, watching 500,000 Sockeye rush through the head water, to flying out to Brooks to watch the bears stock up on food for the winter this area is such an amazing snapshot of one of Earth's remaining heathy ecosystems. 

While I understand the need to adjust with changing times/the short term economic upsides to Pebble Mine, overlooking the long term effect on this region's wildlife and balanced functioning ecosystem would be a irreversible mistake. Harming the environment of a region so rich with wildlife and food source for humans and other animals would have a rippling affect up and down the food chain. 

Myself and so many others make annual trips to towns in Bristol Bay bringing money and tourist jobs to the region. If the animals and fish get affected by the Pebble Mine deposits in the watershed this all drys up. We would be losing another of the dwindling ""untouched"" regions of the world and killing a regions renewable tourist economy. 

I can't stress enough how much I have enjoyed spending time in Bristol Bay and hope to be able to bring my children there to see the same overpowering beauty. Please don't sacrifice this just to increase mineral outputs for the next decade. 

Thank you.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the EPA's May 2017 settlement agreement with Pebble Partnership (a more benign sounding name for Northern Dynasty Mining Company, a Canadian corporation and 100% owner of Pebble Partnership). Though placing a more palatable name may aid in pulling the wool over the eyes of the general public, it certainly should not alter the EPA's mandate to protect our environment. In 2014, the EPA determined that the Clean Water Act prohibited the project proposed for by the Northern Dynasty Mining Company for Bristol Bay.  Notwithstanding the EPA's environmental findings, in May of 2017 the EPA agreed to a settlement with Northern Dynasty Mining Company.  In a nutshell, the settlement terms were as follows: Northern Dynasty would drop the lawsuits it filed against the EPA in exchange for the EPA agreeing to withdraw its regulatory conclusion that Northern Dynasty Mining Company's proposed mining operation violated the Clean Water Act.  The public was not allowed to engage, comment, or otherwise take part in the settlement, which was negotiated behind closed doors. Such is a blatant disregard to the Due Process rights of all Americans who oppose, or for that matter support, the proposal. 
 
Scott Pruitt, the EPA Administrator heralded the settlement, noting that while the EPA was ""committed to due process and the rule of law... [the settlement would] help steer EPA away from costly and time-consuming litigation..."" In what possible world does a backdoor settlement without public comment and consideration of those comments by the EPA equate to compliance with Due Process, or the EPA's rules and regulations? The answer is obvious, it does not. Perhaps the EPA should attempt to comply with the well known mandates of the Administrative Procedures Act which govern the agency's procedural requirements, as well as the public comment period. 

The EPA is not a political party and its scientific findings in  2014 were the same as they are today--the proposal violates the Clean Water Act. However, rather than uphold the EPA's duty to the American public and rely on scientific analysis to determine the effects of a proposal and whether such proposal would violate the Clean Water Act, it is ceding the duty to protect the environment under the auspice of saving the public from costly and time-consuming litigation. Litigation to prevent violations of the Clean Water Act is exactly the type of business that the citizens provide funding (through tax dollars) to the EPA. The EPA is letting the citizens down when it does not perform its intended function, not to mention violates those pesky laws we all are bound to follow. Despite the EPA's stated purpose for the settlement agreement, the true intent is obviously to allow development which will  enrich the Canadian corporation and provide a temporary potential boost to the economy. Yet, that temporary boost would be more than offset by the potentially devastating effects on the fishery, which over the long-haul provide sustainable positions and encourages tourism that will actually be more beneficial to the economy in the long-term. The EPA is currently engaged in a short-sighted analysis that runs counter to the mission of the EPA--i.e. to ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations. 

Rather than adhere to the law, the EPA is simply allowing Northern Dynasty Mining Company to submit its permit, after already determining the proposed mine would violate the Clean Water Act.  Essentially, the EPA's settlement completely nullifies due process and the rule of law, which dictates that the matter be settled by the Administrative Agency (the EPA) and the Northern Dynasty Mining Company.  If the Northern Dynasty Mining Company chooses to fight the EPA's ruling and continue its plan to poison the water,  the Judicial Branch provides the mechanism for such a dispute.  That is the very purpose behind our Constitution's three branches of government and the system of checks and balances, which the settlement completely circumvents. In sum, do your job and uphold the laws of the United States.
 
Donald Trump ran on a pledge to put America first.  Yet, nothing could be more antithetical to putting Americans first than allowing foreign profiteers to bypass the Clean Water Act and imperil Bristol Bay's unparalleled salmon fishery, which accounts for over 14,000 American jobs! Not to mention those are sustainable jobs, whereas a mine provides only temporary employment until the mine is fully harvested. The proposal will leave the public with a Superfund site that it will end up having to float the bill to remedy and deal with the potential environmental disasters. This short-sighted decision will allow a temporary economical boost to threaten sustained employment and a vital food source. In the long-run, this is detrimental to the economy and the environment. I ask you do your job and adhere to the law.

Very truly yours,

Clearly mining and extraction companies operating above the 56th parallel, in both Alaska and Canada, are focused on profit over people and planet. 

Failure to place the highest expectations and requirements to ensure pristine waters will place major subsistence, commercial, and sport fisheries at grave risk.  The recent record harvests of salmon may not be repeated if adequate safe guards are not in place, mining activities are not monitored regularly, and corporation are not held accountable. 

Of course damaging or destroying watersheds have much broader implications and impact the entire riparian ecosystem. We can anticipate loss of water fowl, river otters, beaver and other creatures, large and small that depend on healthy wetlands, streams and rivers. That includes humans. The indigenous people in Southwest Alaska still rely heavily on subsistence foods. Fish, fowl, moose and caribou are critical for households along the streams at risk. Alaska is also one of the last refuges for many Americans and visitors from across the world who come here to experience the beauty, wonder and solitude of the land. The Lake Iliamna region, the Nushagak drainage (including the Mulchatna, Stuyahok, and Koktuli) are a tremendous draw to countless Alaskans and tourists potentially impacted by the failure to safeguard the environment from mining operations, espcially one the scale of Pebble Mine..

Balancing the corporate interests, relentless pursue of resources, and the intangible and prices value of a healthy ecosystem is challenging. When development is essential the the public good (Pebble is questionable as some evidence indicates proper recycling would recover as much copper as the mine would produce in the same period) the EPA is charged with finding that balance. With Pebble Mine that balancing act can begin with ensuring proper safeguards by retaining the restrictions.

Alaska's Bristol Bay is an area of unparalleled ecological richness with salmon, other fish and wildlife species that is unrivaled anywhere in North America and beyond. The Bristol Bay watershed provides a complete, connected habitat from headwaters to ocean that support abundant, genetically diverse wild Pacific salmon populations that maintain the productivity and diversity of the entire ecosystem for other fish and wildlife. 
I do not support the withdrawal of EPA's July 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination for several reasons. First, a major mine project of this type will continue to cause an unacceptable adverse effect that would ""result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"".  With many of the losses being irreversible.  Construction and operation of an open pit mine, management of waste materials from the mine, support facilities including a major transportation system (roads, bridges and culverts), pipelines, a power generating station, wastewater treatment plants, housing and support services for workers, administrative offices, and other infrastructure would continue to result in miles of streams and acres of wetlands and other habitats that are important to salmon and other fish to be lost. Even if PLP is thinking of a smaller project than was originally proposed in 2011, the EPA's July 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination still applies and projections of adverse, irreversible and cumulative effects should the project ever expand also still apply.  The Proposed Determination was carefully prepared by expert scientists and agency officials after several years of study, public involvement and preparation and was fully accepted by an independent peer-reviewed group for scientific and technical information accuracy. 
Second, according to PLP, it would employ over 1,000 people during the mine's lifespan and over 2,000 people during the construction phase.  The projected employment rate is of limited benefit to the community relative to the high risk to the 14,000 full- and part-time workers in the commercial and sport fish fishing industry alone who could lose their livelihoods if an environment accident occurred.  Nearly half of the world's sockeye catch comes from this area and approximately $480 million is generated each year in direct economic expenditures and sales.  This area is also home to a more than 4,000-year-old subsistence-based way of life for Alaska Natives whose history, culture and survival could be devastated as well. 
Lastly, the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States once had sizable wild salmon runs. What remains, mostly in the Pacific, is a faint memory of what once occurred.  Once huge wild Atlantic salmon runs have long been the target of recreational and commercial fishing, and this, as well as habitat destruction is now limited the Atlantic salmon to small remnant populations.  Living in Stanley, Idaho, I have personally seen the effects of dams blocking wild sockeye salmon runs. In the 1880's, an estimated 25,000 and 35,000 sockeye returned annually to the Sawtooth Basin. Dam building in the 1900's put salmon range and population in such peril that in 1992 only one - Lonesome Larry - made it back to Redfish Lake near Stanley.  Idaho's sockeye salmon were listed as ""Endangered"" under the federal Endangered Species Act in November 1991 - the first Idaho salmon species to be listed. Chinook and steelhead were listed as ""Threatened"" near the same time.  In 2017, Idaho's most endangered sockeye salmon has fared only slightly better with 157 salmon migrating 900-mile from the Pacific crossing eight dams and climbing 6,500-feet elevation to the Sawtooth Basin.  Wild salmon have paid a huge price for large scale projects in the lower 48 states in the name of the economic advancement.  
Alaska's Bristol Bay is an area of unmatched ecological abundance with salmon, other fish and wildlife that occurs nowhere else on Earth.  Over 14,000 Alaskan Natives, commercial and sports fisherman depend on salmon for their economic survival. Protection of the Pacific salmon species and its habitat is paramount. Activities such as mining of this size that could cause an unacceptable adverse effect on Pacific wild salmon in Bristol Bay should not be allowed to be permitted, so therefore I do not support the reversal of clean water safeguards on this special area.  I request to be placed on your mailing list to receive all future information about EPA's July 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination and any activity associated with it. 
Thank you.

McElroy,,,False,EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369-0001,,,,2017-10-17T04:00Z,,,,,,,,Public Comment,,,,,,1.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The text for this regulation (Proposal To Withdraw Proposed Determination To Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska, Docket #EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369) includes a regulatory action that the agency should revisit in light of the extensive research which suggests the outcomes of Pebble Mine would harm the economically, culturally, and ecologically significant sockeye salmon runs in Bristol Bay, Alaska. Furthermore, the agency should revisit their own work that concluded Pebble Mine would negatively impact the Bristol Bay watershed, and thus the sockeye salmon run. 

The research summarized below suggests that the outcomes of the Pebble Mine will destroy crucial sockeye spawning habitat and result in devastation of the fishery. 

Bristol Bay has supported one of the most productive sockeye salmon runs in the world since the early 1900s. The communities around Bristol Bay have been reliant on the sockeye populations for food and employment (Knapp et al. 2013), as well as for deep cultural ties to the species (Goldsmith 2007). The other species inhabiting the Bristol Bay watershed (Grizzly and Brown bears, many species of migratory birds, other freshwater fish species, wolves, hawks, eagles) are reliant on sockeye salmon for food (Willson and Halupka 1995) and for the delivery of marine-derived nutrients into the environment (Kline et al. 1993, Schindler 2003, Stockner 2003). It is estimated that Pebble Mine would produce between 2.5 and 10 billion tons of waste containing elements, such as copper and other heavy metals, that would threaten spawning and rearing grounds for sockeye salmon. The increase in acidity of the watershed due to the storage and mining of metal-sulfide ores (USEPA 1994) endangers salmonids by creating an imbalance of chloride and sodium ions in the blood (Morris et al, 1989), which can result in death by osmoregulatory or respiratory failure (Kimmel 1983). The life stages most at risk are the juvenile life stages of eggs and alevin (Rosseland 1986), which are crucial in the recruitment back to the spawning population. Low levels of copper in the water also negatively impacts juvenile salmon by ceasing or slowing growth (Buckley et al. 1982) and by eliminating the neurological and behavioral response to an alarm pheromone, making individuals more susceptible to predation (Baldwin et al. 2003). The impacts of these toxins outlined here could decrease freshwater survival and thus the population of sockeye salmon. The decrease in sockeye salmon populations that would result from Pebble Mine would threaten the rest of the Bristol Bay ecosystem (Chambers et al. 2012) and the surrounding communities. 

Please consider what this action implies regarding the largest sockeye salmon market in the world, the rural native Alaskan economy, and one of the last pristine sockeye salmon habitats.

The biodiversity of the Bristol Bay salmon contributes to the overall stability and sustainability of its fisheries.   As weather patterns and water conditions fluctuate over time, different populations flourish at different times; and different geographic regions and different life history strategies have been the major contributors to the success of the fishery.  Other historical salmon habitats across North America have been destroyed or degraded due to hydroelectric dams, pollution, irrigation and overfishing.  For example, dams permanently block more than 55 percent of the spawning and rearing habitat once available to salmon in the Columbia River Basin in the Northwestern United States.  The dramatic decrease in the Pacific Northwest salmon populations have led to the introduction of hatcheries to replace the lost wild stock.  According to the Fish and Wildlife Service, over 80% of the salmon that now return to the Columbia River Basin is hatchery-reared fish.  Although originally derived from wild populations, years of culturing under artificial conditions have resulted in adaptations and changes to hatchery reared fish.  Hatchery fish are hand-fed, and are reared in a controlled environment, void from predators and natural selection.  Millions of genetically identical hatchery fish are released into the wild each year in an effort to fill the gaps left behind by the ancestral wild salmon.  The lack of genetic variation makes entire populations prone to illnesses and diseases such as whirling disease that can wipe out an entire population.  The hatchery fish that do survive compete with the remaining wild fish for food and habitat, and in some cases spread hatchery born diseases into the wild population.  Less than 1% of the smolts released from the hatcheries return from the ocean to spawn. The Bristol Bay wild salmon populations are vital to the genetic health of the Pacific salmon species and to the livelihood of commercial fisheries that harvest the salmon.  In many waterways throughout western Canada and the United States, these species are listed under the Endangered Species Act.  Salmon habitats in the lower 48, aided by hatchery populations, expect to see a return of a few thousand adult salmon per year.  In Bristol Bay, between 25 million and 50 million wild salmon return to its watershed every year, making it the largest wild salmon fishery in the world. This migration is responsible for bringing in over $500 million a year and sustaining over 11,000 jobs. The industry is vital to not only the native population, but also to the state and national economies. This is a renewable resource that will always provide, as long as we take care of it for future generations.
The proposed site is situated at the headwaters of two of the larger watersheds within the Bristol Bay ecosystem. The proposed operation is so massive, that it would be considered the largest open pit mine ever built (7 square miles). The energy and water required to operate the facility would be greater than that of the entire state of Alaska per year. Earthen dams taller than the Hoover Dam would be built to contain the acid-rich poisonous overburden forever. The metal-containing ores at Pebble are rich in sulfide minerals.  These minerals generate acid that when exposed to air and water, produce Acid Mine Drainage.  This drainage is the main source of water pollution associated with mines.  Another potential hazard at the mine complex includes pollution from the proposed on-site power plant that in undoubtedly pollute the surrounding air and water.  Furthermore, the ore slurry dug up at mine would be transported via a haul road past Lake Iliamna to the Cook Inlet. Northern Dynasty is notorious for adversely impacting the local environment, most notably through tailing dam failures into waterways. 
The proposed Pebble Mine has a 50 year lifespan. At which point, the Canadian company will pick up and leave, leaving the mess for us to deal with. Although short term profits are alluring to investors and well-connected politicians, they are short lived. Bristol Bay is already rich with a sustainable and clean resource: Salmon. Do not jeopardize this resource by selfishly authorizing a project no one wants. $500 million a year, forever. Why can't that be enough?

I am opposed to EPAs proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

My view is quite bias towards pro-fisheries, but that is ok because this is my opinion and view on the subject. When you weight the options of creating a new mine there are many ecological and environmental factors that must be considered. Allowing a Canadian company to internationally mine for precious metals has many negative affects. This may build better relations with Canadian companies and turn a ""small"" profit, but it is not a long-term investment. The watershed will continuously turn a profit through the salmon that are collected (46% of the worlds supply of salmon) as well as all money and resources spent in the process of fishing for the salmon. Along with the profit from sales, the salmon provide many resources for the environment. A drastic decrease in salmon will have a catastrophic effect on the ecosystem throughout Bristol Bay.

To withdraw the prior determination now and restart the permit application process is an egregious waste of public resources and the US taxpayer's money and time, with no added benefit. 

The rationale for the EPA proposal to withdraw the 2014 determination, in this case, has been promoted as a way to adhere to process and procedures, but that rationale ignores that an equally important and legally valid process was followed for the 2014 scientific determination, under a provision of the Clean Water Act. Through a years-long process of extensive scientific study and community engagement, the 2014 determination concluded that mining activities in the region would be uniquely destructive to one of the world's most valuable salmon fisheries.

The majority of Alaskans have overwhelmingly voted to reject this project in any form.  Industries that will be affected by the mine's inevitable and unavoidable environmental impacts have rejected this project. The people employed in sustainable, broad-based industries across the region have rejected this project. Most importantly, the Native American tribes who rely on the natural resources of the Bristol Bay watershed have resoundingly rejected this project. 

The developer of the mine seeks to restart the application process without regard to the costs to taxpayers, the waste of public resources and agency resources, and the clear rejection by those most affected, for a project that has already been conclusively, scientifically demonstrated is not in the national interest. 

The data on the environmental impacts has not changed. Public opinion against the Pebble Mine project has not changed.  Any objective observer familiar with the scientific facts would conclude that mining activities in the Bristol Bay watershed region would be uniquely damaging to a crucial natural resource that is a sustainable generator of considerable economic activity.  Withdrawing the 2014 determination solely benefits a foreign private mining company, and draws out a redundant, expensive, time-consuming process with no additional benefit to the US public, at US taxpayer expense. Withdrawing the the 2014 determination is not in the national interest, and the proposal should be rejected.

Dear Administrator Pruitt,

I strongly urge you not to withdraw the proposed determination under the Clean Water Act to restrict the use of waters in Southeast Alaska as disposal sites for dredged or filled materials associated with mining the Pebble deposit. 

The wild salmon run in Bristol Bay is an incredible natural resource that sustains a $1.5 billion fishery and supports an estimated 14,000 jobs. As the daughter of a commercial fisherman, the Bristol Bay fishery is of incredible personal importance to me. My father has been fishing in Bristol Bay since the 1980s, and today he operates a successful seining operation through which he employs all three of my siblings. My family's livelihood quite literally depends on the continued sustainability of Bristol Bay's wild salmon run, and having grown up in Southcentral Alaska, I know countless families for which the same is true. 

A development like the Pebble Mine poses a massive threat to one of the world's last wild salmon runs, along with the thousands of small businesses that it supports. From an economic perspective alone, this mine does not make sense. The people of Alaska stand behind the protection of Bristol Bay and its vast resources, and the EPA should do the same.

Sincerely, 

Teresa Wisner

Dear EPA and Mr. Pruitt,

I am pro-Pebble Mine and for the withdrawing of the EPA  proposed determination against Pebble.
My family and I have personally have benefited from working in different realms of natural resources in Alaska. 

Pebble Mine is a great opportunity that Alaska residents need. We are in a dire economic situation. Oil drilling is being less without ANWR. This has affected me personally and other family members. 

Pebble has provided opportunities when other opportunities are becoming less. I am absolutely pro fish/salmon and pro pebble mine. I believe that it is absolutely possible to have both in the same state/ same region/ same area. Not only is it possible, it really truly is essential to the well being of the state, residents, and country. 

I sincerely hope that the EPA continues to give Pebble a chance at bettering the economy, state, and country. In creation of jobs, bringing together difficult tribes and citizens as a whole.

Pro-Pebble Pro-Fish

Mining causes irreversible damage that affects not only the land but wildlife, fresh waters, sea, families and finances. The land is much more valuable as a natural resource for wildlife, subsistence living, commercial fishing, sport fishing, hunting, tourism, farming, and renewable energies.

We do not need another open pit copper mine. We need food, clean air, clean water, friends, family, and community.

As a native of Iliamna, I believe Pebble Limited Partnership should have a fair opportunity to complete 
an Environmental Impact Statement in the same manner as any other mining company - and be judged purely
on the results and merit of the EIS.

I find it sad that section 404c of the Clean Water Act was used to render a decision on Pebble without
the company receiving a fair chance to begin the permitting process and have an EIS completed.

The Pebble Mine is an opportunity for jobs to flurish in an area that currently has none.

I specifically object to the current EPA proposal to withdraw the July 2014 Proposed Determination to restrict the discharge of dredged or fill material associated with the potential ""Pebble Mine"" in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed.

Land use changes in the lower 48 states have been major contributors to the dramatic decline of the salmon fishery in the Pacific Ocean, adding sediment and pollutants to rivers in which these fish spawn. This has led to severe restrictions on commercial and sport salmon fishing along the US west coast, with economic ripple effects through fishing communities. 

In 2014, the EPA conducted a thorough risk assessment of the potential impacts of large-scale mining on Bristol Bay's world-class commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries as well as on the native Alaskan peoples whose culture is strongly rooted in the fishing tradition. On the basis of this evaluation, they proposed to restrict discharge of dredged or fill material, pursuant to the Clean Water Act. 

The current Director of the EPA seeks to reverse this decision. This action would be a terrible mistake, with impacts not only to the fishery itself, but to the many fishermen (including Native Americans) and to the entire ecosystem based on salmon-derived nutrients. 

Opening the door to the Pebble Mine would be the only the beginning of a disastrous crash in the Alaskan salmon fishery and all those that depend on it. We've done this already in the lower 48 states. Let's learn from the past, and keep the July 2014 Proposed Determination in place.

There has been endless review, scientific study, public testimony, that all point to it's being a dangerous risk to take even in the best of circumstances.

The science doesn't support a ""risk free"" assessment.
The people don't support it.
And the potential economic benefits to a few workers locally, with most of the profits being taken by people outside the region, and indeed the country, who mostly couldn't point to Bristol Bay on a map, do not add up to make it worth the risk.

I ask that you not withdraw the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination, which it made pursuant to the Clean Water Act in 2014.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA to step in to ensure that this mine would not jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs.

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. The proposed Pebble Mine presents a long-term risk to the sustainability of this important fishery, and all the people and businesses that rely on it. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value.

Many families rely on wild salmon as a uniquely nutritious source of protein, rich in essential omega-3 fats and vitamin D. Farmed salmon is not nutritionally identical (much lower in vitamin D, much higher in saturated fats and pro-inflammatory omega-6 fats) and poses its own environmental risks. Salmon is an important species for the health of the environment in keeping a balanced ecosystem and returning important nutrients to the ecosystem. The environmental impact is worth more than any price tag can capture. I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery.

Sincerely,

This watershed is extremely important for current Native Alaskan populations, and for the local fish populations. From the 2014 determination, Bristol Bay ""is an area of unparalleled ecological value, boasting salmon diversity and productivity unrivaled anywhere in North America."" (1) Not only is the area a draw for tourism, both for it's beauty and for recreational fishing, many important salmon species call the bay home. Adding mine tailings and slag to this watershed will irreparably harm this ecosystem. Even with certain containment practices in place, the run off from the mine and the likelihood of containment failure means heavy metals will end up in the water. We have already studies how lipophillic metals and compounds bioaccumulate into our fish, then end up in our bodies. Even if concentrations are low, people would likely become scared of fishing in that area, or eating the fish there, and it would cost the overall economy much more than any potential gain. The modest positive impact from jobs at the mine will pale in comparison to the possible loss that could occur to both fishing and travel industries.

It is extremely clear based upon the 2014 proposed determination by the EPA, even when given the chance to, neither party was able to sufficiently prove that the mining slag wouldn't harm the environment:

""Both NDM/PLP and the State of Alaska submitted information that raised scientific and technical issues, most of which had been previously raised in public comments on the Bristol Bay Assessment. However, this information did not demonstrate to the satisfaction of EPA Region 10 that no unacceptable adverse effects on fishery areas will occur should the disposal of dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit proceed."" (1) 

Read simply: Neither party submitted information able to demonstrate that no unacceptable adverse effects will occur. It is clear that withdrawing the restriction will have horrible negative impacts to the local ecosystem, water quality, fishing and tourism industries and the people living in the area. For these reasons, I urge you not to turn your back on clean water.

I am writing to voice my objection to opening up of the permitting process for the Pebble Partnership.  

My background is in fisheries science and I completed my Masters in Science working with populations of sockeye salmon from Bristol Bay. There are three main reasons why Bristol Bay salmon and the environment there should be protected, especially from an enormous open pit mine.  

The first main reason is an ecological one. Bristol Bay is perhaps the most intact, productive large-scale freshwater system in North America.  It's not difficult to see why. Tens of millions of salmon return annually bringing nutrients they've spent a lifetime accumulating in the ocean. This pulse of nutrients from the sea is the basis of a food web that spans freshwater and terrestrial environments and ranges from microscopic invertebrates to keystone species like brown bears. They key ingredient in all of this is the salmon, without them the entire ecological system would cease to exist as it has for millions of years.

The second reason for protection of Bristol Bay is an economic argument.  Bristol Bay supports one of the largest commercial fisheries in the world and is responsible for the majority of sockeye salmon taken to market in the US.  The salmon fishery and associated industries (processors, marine suppliers, boat mechanics, etc.) support 14000+ jobs annually and are responsible for a multi-hundred million dollar economy every year.  Better yet, sockeye salmon are a sustainable resource that if managed properly can support this economy in perpetuity.  Furthermore, the sockeye salmon fishery is also considered one of the most sustainable fisheries in the world. Managers are able to determine which stocks within the larger fishery appear to be preforming well on a year-to-year basis, which allows an adaptive fishery to shift efforts to stocks with the most robust returns while leaving other, less bountiful stocks with lower pressure.  It is a model system for managers and industry. Beyond the commercial fishery, sockeye salmon as the basis for a productive food web, contribute to one of the premier sport fisheries in the US, where individuals may spend up to $20,000 over ten days to fly out to, float on, and fish for salmon and trout.

The final reason for not following through with the permitting of the Pebble Project is a cultural one. For Native Alaskans in Bristol Bay, sockeye salmon have been the lifeblood for their table, culture, and spiritual ceremonies for tens of thousands of years.  We rail against the destruction of ancient artifacts and holy relics when it occurs in other nations, but the loss of these fish would amount to the loss of the foundation of culture and faith in the region.  Beyond Native Alaskans, salmon and natural productivity and beauty are defining characters of life and culture in Alaska.  It's why people move and stay there. Alaska is perhaps the most unique state in the Union, its character largely driven by places like Bristol Bay.

Finally, a few parting notes. First, this issue was largely settled until Administrator Pruitt sat down for a brief meeting with leader of the Pebble Partnership. While I understand that these actions may be in the purview of the agency, I also note that the EPA previously decided to protect the region with an uncommon regulatory option of the Clean Water Act. Supporters of the Pebble Mine pointed to this as an overreach of regulation.  But, for anyone who has known or visited Bristol Bay, such a remarkable place called for remarkable action.  I'll leave you with this note.  A major driver of the fear for a project like Pebble is that this particular industry (hard rock mining) has had very little accountability and one of the poorest track records for environmental regard.  The Berkeley Pit Mine in Butte Montana was built on the headwaters of Clark Fork River.  The mine poisoned the river and the region's residents for generations.  When the mine became unprofitable, ownership shuttered their doors, leaving Montanans to deal with the mess and Americans to pick up the check (now approaching $50 billion). This story has been repeated time and time again for mega-project open-pit mines. Even more recently, the tailings dam of the Mt. Polley mine burst on a tributary of the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada, flooding BC's most productive sockeye salmon river with billions of gallons of toxic sludge.  Moreover, the toxic byproduct of projects like these are expected to be stored on the landscape in perpetuity.  How will the Pebble Partnership keep these toxic elements from this pristine landscape 1000 years from now when they no longer exist as a business.  Mine tailings always outlive the companies that produced them.  You have heard plenty from Alaskans and people supporting Bristol Bay protection. Please listen.

Thank you for your consideration of these comments,

Morgan Sparks, M.S.

Proposed Pebble Mine
The Proposed Pebble Mine is Against the Interests of the American People, the People of Alaska, and Local AlaskansIncluding Indigenous PeopleLiving Within the Watershed of the Nushagak and Kvichak Rivers
After three years of scientifically rigorous study, the EPA released its final assessment of the proposed Pebble Mine entitled, The Effects of Large Scale Mining on the Salmon Ecosystems of the Nushagak and Kvichak Rivers, in January 2014. This EPA assessment concluded that, if proposed Pebble Mine operations were to be undertaken, ""It is expected that the North Fork Koktuli River ... and much of the Koktuli River would not support salmonids [that is, all forms of salmon] in the short term (less than 10 years)."" Given that the totality of the scientific evidence presented in its assessment indicates complete destruction of Salmon habitat in the watershed, under law, the EPA cannot exempt the proposed Pebble Mine from provisions of the Clean Water Act nor can the agency do anything but recommend against proposed mining operation at the Pebbles Mine.
The Bristol Bay watershed, located in southwestern Alaska, is home to 25 federally recognized tribal governments representing Alaska Native peoples who have maintained a salmon-based way of life for the last 4,000 years, at least, probably for much longer. Clearly, large-scale mining operations in the watershed proposed by the Pebbles Mine will destroy the sustainability of Bristol Bay's world-class commercial, recreational, as well as the subsistence fisheries upon which the future of Alaska Native tribes in the watershed depends. Given the potential impact on the way of life of Alaskan Native peoples, under law, the EPA cannot allow the proposed Pebbles Mine to move forward in any form.

The proposed Pebbles Mine project, with mineral rights, is controlled by Canadian, British, Australian, and Japanese corporations; therefore, little economic benefit will accrue to the United States yet the Alaskan people living within the watershed will bear a tremendous burden as their way of life is destroyed.

The Arguments Made by Pebble Mine Proponents Are Specious
Proponents of the Pebble Mine claim that the mine would provide significant tax revenue to the State of Alaska; however, no amount of tax revenue accruing from proposed mining operations can offset the costs that local, state, and federal governments would bear as the Bristol Bay watershed is destroyed.

Proponents of the Pebble Mine claim that the mine will create well-paying jobs in an increasingly poverty-stricken regionroughly 2,000 jobs for construction, dropping to 1,000 permanent jobs during the 30 to 60-year expected life span of the mine. However, the returning salmon and other ecological resources of the Bristol Bay watershed creates more than 14,000 full and part-time jobs, generates approximately $480 million annually, and supports a 4,000-year-old Alaska Native way of life.
Proponents of the Pebble Mine claim that the mine would provide a domestic resource of important raw materials thus lowering the United States reliance on foreign sources. However, because markets for these and similar raw materials are global, such claims are clearly specious. Furthermore, such a ""domestic resource of raw materials"" does not now exist nor will mining operations at the proposed Pebble Mine create one.

EPA Must Follow Mandates Established by Law

Environment Protection Agency Mandates Established by Law
By law, it is the mandate of the EPA to protect both the health of the American people and the environment of the United States and its territories. Protecting the American people from significant health risks requires that the EPA must develop science-based regulations that are protective of the environment, wherever people live, work, and learn. 

Assault on the Environment Protection Agency Must Stop Immediately
The Trump/Pence Administration's unnecessary assault on the EPA is against the interests of the American people in that the assault directly undermines the fundamental basis of human health; the assault promotes the continuation of the widespread pollution of critical segments of the county's environment; and, to the extent that the administration deliberately fails to uphold environmental protection law, the assault is clearly unlawful. For the reasons cited above, the Trump/Pence Administration must immediately stop its increasingly unlawful assault on the Environmental Protection Agency and its mission!

The CWA section 404 allows the EPA to override the Corp and veto the ""404 permit for dredge and fill discharge if it is having or will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas), wildlife, or recreational areas,"" (EPA).  The EPA's 3 year study of the area showed negative impacts on water from the start and it's their duty to use the 404-C veto in such large scale projects, in highly valued areas, with relatively high possibilities of catastrophic events. Have no doubt that this is a highly valued area because of both its intrinsic and economic value. Extensive studies done pertaining to the environmental externalities that would be associated with mining in the area, prove over and over that mining here is a terrible decision. Also from an economic standpoint it is stated that the mine will only provide 1,000 temporary jobs, but it will threaten 14,000 commercial fishing jobs that are a part of the local salmon fishery (Bautista). While this fishing industry will likely be wiped out as the salmon spawning grounds are poisoned from the mine and its disposal site.  
So it is the EPA's duty not to withdraw the proposed determination in this case, because the Pebble Mine needs to be stopped before it even has a chance to start due to the extensive and negative impacts it would have on human-environmental health; and the health of the commercial fishing industry.

I am writing to voice my opposition to withdrawing the determination to restrict the use of the Bristol Bay watershed as a disposal site.

The proposed open pit mine, dug in seismically unstable marshland would pose a huge risk to one of the only self-sustaining salmon fisheries in the world. The tailings from the mine are highly toxic, and would need to be contained in perpetuity.Several years of independent study commissioned by the EPA have demonstrated that the mine itself and the infrastructure needed to support the mine jeopardize the health and stability of the Bristol Bay ecosystem. This ecosystem provides economic and subsistence support to tens of thousands of people, including thousands of Yupik, Alutiiq, and Dena'ina indigenous Alaskans who have relied upon the watershed for subsistence for hundreds of years. 

This proposed mine is extremely likely to become an environmental and economic disaster, and it is entirely appropriate for the EPA to exercise its regulatory authority to prevent such misuse of land that belongs to every American.

I am in favor of continuing to protect the Watershed of Bristol bay and it tributaries under the Clean Water Act. Not only for the people that live downstream, but because it will significantly affect the fisheries that depend on clean water and fishing to survive. It is not right that the Pebble Mine and its subsidiaries to be able to dump mining waste upstream. The head of the EPA has said ""We aren't picking winners and losers"" and yet, in all aspects, it seems that the current EPA is picking winners and losers. The winners in this case would be the Pebble Mine Corporation over the people that inhabit the Bristol Bay Area, and the potential disasterous effects on clean water and fishing, as well as tourism to the area. Fishing, backpacking, paddling and the outdoor industry contribute more to the Economy than you would imagine. It should be taken into account how reversing the decision on the Pebble Mine waste would effect not only the people and animals that depend on clean rivers/tributaries to survive, but how it will affect those that contribute to the economy through outdoor pursuits aforementioned. This potential reversal, does not respect the lengthy public comment period and input from the initial ruling in 2014. How can the EPA initiate a withdrawal process, when this has already been settled? What right does the Administrator have to change the law as he sees fit? Why would the administrator settle with PLP and subsidiaries over public interest? Is there a quid quo pro going on? Why is such power given to the Administrator Of the EPA, over public interest? ""EPA agreed to initiate this proposed withdrawal process pursuant to policy direction from EPA's Administrator and as part of a May 11, 2017 settlement agreement with the Pebble Limited Partnership"" why wouldn't the public be notified to comment BEFORE the EPA agreed to initiate the withdrawal process?

In fact, the Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, producing approximately 46% of the world's wild sockeye harvest. That's the good news!

Here's the bad news, the Bristol Bay watershed is also home to the Pebble deposit, a large underground body of mineral ore.  And, the Pebble Limited Partnership, a project of Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd, hopes to mine for copper and gold there, in the heart of the Bristol Bay watershed.  

According to the Pebble Partnership, mining the Pebble deposit could involve excavation of the largest open pit mine in North America, covering up to 6.9 square miles and reaching a depth of as much as 0.77 mile, nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon. Additionally, the EPA found that ""mine components (mine pit, tailings impoundments (dams of mining debris), and waste rock piles) would cover an area larger than Manhattan..."" and ""require the construction of support facilities...and infrastructure...greatly expand(ing) the ""footprint"" of the mine and affect(ing) additional aquatic resources...losses would be irreversible.""

In its 2014 404(c) Proposed Determination for Bristol Bay, the EPA wisely denied the Pebble Partnership permission to proceed pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act.

Turning its back on its own extensively researched, peer-reviewed, science-based Determination for Bristol Bay, in a startling reversal, the EPA now would allow the Pebble Partnership to proceed.

Dear Administrator Pruitt and Acting Region 10 Administrator Pirzadeh:

The single most consistent thing about the Trump Administration is that they put fossil fuel profits ahead of our health and our communities. WHAT DOES THE EPA STAND FOR?????? Profits or human health?

I am a supporter of Slow Food USA, the national, not-for-profit organization dedicated to a food chain that is good, clean, and fair for all.  I write to urge the US Environmental Protection Agency to protect Bristol Bay, Alaska, from the Pebble Mine that would threaten the region's irreplaceable fish and wildlife resources and the 14,000 jobs that depend on Bristol Bay's clean, healthy waters and fishery.  EPA must keep in place the 2014 Bristol Bay 404(c) Proposed Determination.

According to EPA study, the Bristol Bay watershed provides vital habitat for 29 fish species, more than 190 bird species, and more than 40 terrestrial animals. All five species of Pacific salmonsockeye, Chinook, coho, chum, and pinkspawn and rear in the pristine Bristol Bay watershed. The Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, producing approximately 46% of the world's wild sockeye harvest, creating $1.5 billion in economic output and nearly 20,000 jobs throughout the United States annually.

EPA's scientific study contains highly concerning facts about the proposed Pebble Mine: even without a mine disaster, exploitation of the Pebble deposit will destroy 94 miles of salmon streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, lakes, and ponds. Overall, EPA concluded that mining the headwaters of the Bristol Bay river systems could cause irreparable harm to the valuable Bristol Bay fishery, wildlife, and communities.

I stand with more than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen who oppose the Pebble Mine.  Because of its great, ecological, economic, and cultural value, I implore the EPA to stand with us by keeping in place the 404(c) Proposed Determination for Bristol Bay, Southwest Alaska.

RE: Bristol Bay, Alaska/Pebble Mine - Docket: EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369
Dear Administrator Pruitt and Acting Region 10 Administrator Pirzadeh:

I am writing to urge the US Environmental Protection Agency to protect Bristol Bay, Alaska, from the Pebble Mine that would threaten the region's irreplaceable fish and wildlife resources and the 14,000 jobs that depend on Bristol Bay's clean, healthy waters and fishery. The Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, producing approximately 46% of the world's wild sockeye harvest, creating $1.5 billion in economic output and nearly 20,000 jobs throughout the United States annually.
Because of its great, ecological, economic, and cultural value, I urge the EPA to keep in place the 404(c) Proposed Determination for Bristol Bay, Southwest Alaska.
Thank you for your attention.

The proposed Pebble Mine and its disposal sites pose a drastic threat to the Bristol Bay sockeye fishery, the largest sockeye salmon fishery in North America.  It provides a living for thousands of US citizen workers and is sustainable indefinitely into the future.

The pebble mine is of benefit to shareholders mostly outside the United States and provides them only short term profit at the risk of the livelihood of all involved with the salmon fishery.  This is an awful trade and should not be allowed.

Do not allow the Pebble Limited Partnership to mine in the Bristol Bay watershed.  The toxins from the tailings etc and the
mine activities would ruin the area...the area which is home to the largest remaining salmon run, many species of fish and
other aquatic life...you spent time before extensively studying the issue; after this study which was peer-reviewed and science-
based, you(EPA) denied the Pebble Partnership permission to mine(ruin the area)...see section 404(c) of the Clean Water
Act.

Look at the ruined watershed and fisheries and life in Canada in the Calgary area...destruction related to the tar sands extraction

I am furious over your decision to withdraw the EPA Region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination that was issued pursuant of
the Clean Water Act, to restrict the use of certain waters in the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper 
Talarik Creek watersheds in southwest Alaska. 
Have you ever been to this region? Do you understand the impact if the mine is approved? Do you ever get out in nature, in 
order to understand what we stand to lose? My guess is a loud ""NO""!!
I live in Seattle, and have watched our salmon population dwindle steadily over the last few decades. Our orca population is
dwindling as well, with newborn calves dying in the first year of life, believed to be a result of starvation. The orca feed on 
salmon, so they are the canary in the coal mine for the health of Puget Sound, and the entire northwest. 
I implore you to reverse this decision!!
It's bad enough that the Trump administration is reversing decisions to save protected areas in places like the Grand 
Staircase Escalante in Utah. Having just spent time hiking in that region, I was appalled to learn that Trump is trying to reverse
its status and protection. Have you visited our national parks and monuments in Utah, or anywhere for that matter? Not just 
taking a photo or two, but actually getting out on the trails, seeing rare beauty that will bring you to tears?
Alaska is the last hope for preserving any truly natural, untouched, unspoiled land in our country, and indeed, our world. How 
can you possibly believe the Pebble Mining Company is more important than this? How can you risk FOREVER losing this 
place for SHORT TERM GAIN by a mining company???????
I'm astounded that someone who clearly does not even believe the EPA should exist was appointed to head the agency. I 
pray that you are all thrown out in 2020!!!!!!!
Most Sincerely,
Patricia Anderson

US Environmental Protection Agency 

RE: Bristol Bay, Alaska/Pebble Mine - Docket: EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369

Dear Administrator Pruitt and Acting Region 10 Administrator Pirzadeh:

I am a supporter of Slow Food USA, the national, not-for-profit organization dedicated to a food chain that is good, clean, and fair for all.  I write to urge the US Environmental Protection Agency to protect Bristol Bay, Alaska, from the Pebble Mine, which would threaten the region's irreplaceable fish and wildlife resources as well as the14,000 jobs that depend on Bristol Bay's clean, healthy waters and fishery.  In the interest of keeping Americans employed, fed, and protecting our environment's resources, the EPA must keep in place the 2014 Bristol Bay 404(c) Proposed Determination.

According to EPA study, the Bristol Bay watershed provides vital habitat for 29 fish species, more than 190 bird species, and more than 40 terrestrial animals. All five species of Pacific salmonsockeye, Chinook, coho, chum, and pinkspawn and rear in the pristine Bristol Bay watershed. The Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, producing approximately 46% of the world's wild sockeye harvest, creating $1.5 billion in economic output and nearly 20,000 jobs throughout the United States annually. A positive for American jobs as well as the 250+ species depending on that Bay.

EPA's scientific study contains highly concerning facts about the proposed Pebble Mine: even without a mine disaster, exploitation of the Pebble deposit will destroy 94 miles of salmon streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, lakes, and ponds. Overall, EPA concluded that mining the headwaters of the Bristol Bay river systems could cause irreparable harm to the valuable Bristol Bay fishery, wildlife, and communities.

I stand with more than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen who oppose the Pebble Mine.  Because of its great, ecological, economic, and cultural value, I implore the EPA to stand with us by keeping in place the 404(c) Proposed Determination for Bristol Bay, Southwest Alaska. Protect the environment, employ Americans, and keep the salmon running!

Thank you for your attention.

I write to register my comments on EPA's proposed action to withdraw the 2014 Proposed Determination to restrict mining in the waters of the Bristol Bay watershed, specifically the waters in the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds in southwest Alaska.  I am vehemently opposed to the withdrawal of the Proposed Determination.  These watersheds must be protected from mining and specifically from the Pebble Limited Partnership proposed Pebble mine.    The EPA's determination in July 2014 was the correct decision and was based on through examination of the science, and the through vetting of the public and interested and affected parties.  The reversal of this decision would be clearly arbitrary and would ignore all the science and public comment that came before.  

The science is clear - - any mine, and especially the mine proposed for the Pebble Deposit would risk bringing irreparable harm to one of the few, if not the only, robust, expanding, salmon runs in the world.  One only has to look at the status of salmon in every other watershed of the United States, where they are meager if not on the edge of disappearing to understand the value of the salmon fishery of Bristol Bay watershed.  Bristol Bay is singularly unique in that its salmon populations are strong and are expanding due to the fact the watershed has not been impacted by activities such as mining and development.  

From an economic standpoint, reversing the Proposed Determination of 2014 is wrong.  Bristol Bay supports an American industry - - a thriving fishing industry and it provides thousands of jobs for Americans directly and indirectly and it supports countless American communities - -not only in Alaska, but in states throughout the United States.  Pebble Partnership is a company based in and run by a foreign government.  How can EPA pick to a one foreign company over an American industry? 

It appears that the only basis for a decision to reverse the 2014 Determination is political.  There has been no solid rationale provided that can justify overturning a solid, peer reviewed scientific basis nor the disregard for years of public vetting for which the preponderance of comments were in opposition of the proposed Pebble Deposit mine. 

I urge you with every fiber in my being not to withdraw the 2014 Determination.

Sincerely,

I am writing to implore the EPA to maintain its protections of the Pebble Deposit Area in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed.  It is widely recognized that that area is home to the world's largest salmon fishery.  Removing the protections that are in place for that particular area threatens to destroy large portions, if not all, of that fishery.  This would have significant financial, societal and environmental costs to America and its citizens.  

Financially, the fishery supports thousands of jobs linked to salmon fishing.  Those jobs would be lost by removing the existing protections in the area.  A three-year study conducted by the EPA concluded in 2014 that the allowance of mining activities by companies like Northern Dynasty Minerals (a Canadian, not American, company) would result in a complete loss of salmon habitat in significant portions of the watershed.  What's more, the jobs created by Northern Dynasty Minerals' mining operations would be fewer than the fishing jobs that would be lost as a result of salmon habitat destruction by Northern Dynasty.  The net effect would be to reduce available jobs rather than to increase them.

From a societal standpoint, the watershed produces nearly half of the world's annual sockeye salmon catch.  Salmon is a prominent part of the American and world diet, with Americans consuming it raw in sushi/sashimi, smoked, and grilled, broiled, and baked.  A growing segment of the world's population has come to appreciate wild, rather than farm-raised, salmon.  Destruction of this fishery will significantly curtail the availability of wild salmon in grocery stores and restaurants. Most Americans, along with those who purchase our salmon will feel this loss.

From an environmental perspective it should be recognized that fisheries, like the one located at Bristol Bay, take many centuries to develop.  They cannot be easily replaced or repaired.  

Destroying our fisheries, poisoning a pristine environment, eliminating jobs, and reducing a significant portion of the world's salmon population does not Make America Great Again.  It, instead, undermines America.

Please maintain the existing protections of the Pebble Deposit Area and its salmon fishery.

The watershed affected by the Pebble Mine Project in Alaska includes the Bristol Bay Red (Sockeye) Salmon migration and the historic Brooks River/Falls Salmon/Rainbow runs including Brown Bear gathering at Brooks Falls, Alaska.  As a lifetime member of the Hairy Dog Fly Fishing Organization, and frequent visitor to Brooks Camp, Katmailand Anglers Paradise Fishing Camps in Katmai National Park, Alaska, I am angered and disappointed by the decision of Scott Pruitt, Head of the EPA to withdraw a plan to protect the watershed of Bristol Bay, Alaska.  I am a Republican, voted for President Donald Trump, and have given great support to the dismantling of many of the disasterous EPA 's over-reaching regulations enacted by the Obama Administration.  However, in having a direct experience and knowlege regarding the potential destruction to a pristine irreplaceable natural resource the Pebble Mine might destroy, I  voice my strong objection to the actioins of Mr. Pruitt.   

I hope my thoughts and the desires of many of my friends who visit Alaska on a regular basis,  to enjoy this ""Last True American Wilderness"" experience, will outweigh the short term temporary rewards of metal mining, which has left permanent expensive reclamation scars all over our Country including Idaho, Montana, California, etc.

PROTECT THE WATERSHED OF BRISTOL BAY ALASKA!!!


REINSTITUTE THE PLAN TO PROTECT THIS  UNIQUE, PRISTINE, IRREPLACEABLE, VALUABLE, NATURAL RESOURCE OF THE BRISTOL BAY WATERSHED!!!

As a fisheries biologist and an avid salmon fisherman, I do not agree that a mining company should be allowed to mine nor dispose of mining waste in the Bristol Bay watershed. History shows us what mining does to the local environment and valuable fish populations. It is imperative to consider the monetary and emotional costs of the local community's recreational and commercial fisheries compared with the profit of the mining venture. The long term value of recreational and commercial salmon fisheries in Bristol Bay, Alaska most likely trump the short term profitability of a mining venture. 

Monetary and emotional values are among the most important issues the argument against the opening of mining permits in Bristol Bay. The health risks on the local human and wildlife communities and water quality degradation associated with mining waste should also be considered. No matter the manner in which these assessments are carried out, they should be done in the most calculated and scientific way possible, free of partisan politics, with the most weight put on the long term health of the local community, both financially and emotionally. I am all for economic development, but I do not think that the mining of Bristol Bay is the right way to do it. Please do not open the bay up for mining permits. 

Thank you.

The proposal to withdrawal The proposed determination to restrict the use of an area as a disposal site is wrong.  The EPA should not allow a FOREIGN-OWNED mining company to fowl the crown jewel of THE AMERICAN SOCKEYE SALOMON FISHERY INDUSTRY.

The corruption at the head of the EPA, Administrator Scott Pruitt, to overturn years of scientific research on the water shed area known as Bristol Bay within 30 minutes of meeting with the CEO OF PEBBLE MINING LTD is unprecedented in the history of the EPA.  That on top of the fact that he dismissed a lawsuit filed by the United States EPA against Pebble Mining LTD. screams corruption.  The CEO of PEBBLE MINING LTD is shot-sided if he thinks that a proposed mine that is bigger than the island of Manhattan and deeper than the Grand Canyon will not harm the prestige ecological preserve of Bristol Bay.

The fact that this proposed mining operation will disrupt the income, livelihood and spiritual well-being of indigenous people of Native Alaska is lost on the EPA if they go further with this proposal.

I am against the Scott Pruitt and the EPA from withdrawal the determination and also against Pebble Group LTD fromreceuvung the permit to operate a gold and copper mine in Bristol Bay, Alaska.

The returning salmon and other ecological resources create some 14,000 full- and part-time jobs, generate about $480 million annually -- and support 4,000-year-old Alaska Native cultures."" I FEEL THIS PROVES SUSTAINABLE VALUE AS IS. ""Such a mine ""would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of the bay watershed, the EPA found after three years of peer-reviewed research. In particular, the EPA estimated 22 miles of streams and more than 6 square miles of wetlands and other habitats that are important to salmon and other fish would be lost to a large-scale mine."" THIS IS BACKED BY SCIENCE. 
""All of these losses would be irreversible,"" the agency said.""Under the Obama administration, people were willing to say, 'Look, it's very clear, this is exactly the worst place you could imagine building a mine of that kind,"" said Ray Hilborn, a professor in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington. ""It's not just that you have the most valuable salmon fishery in the world, it's the nature of the habitat there.

But after the mine was first proposed, he said, he started touring mines that had been shut down. 
He saw pools of toxic water, massive piles of waste-rock. At one mine in Nevada, he said, he was told to cover his shoes for fear he would track dust laden with heavy metals home -- and ""not to have any contact with that dust with our eyes, not to touch any of the water.""
Could Bristol Bay turn into a similar wasteland? He decided he didn't want to find out.

The proposal is ridiculous, it will effect the entire pacific's salmon populations and people's ability to earn a living, not if toxic waste is released into the water shed, but when it is released.

While mining can be and often is an economic good, large scale mining operations should not be allowed in the Bristol Bay watershed. 

The EPA conducted a thorough, multi-year scientific investigation of the Bristol Bay Watershed and potential impacts of the proposal(s) by Northern Dynasty to mine the Pebble Deposit.  Based on the projected impacts of a mine far smaller than those proposed by Northern Dynasty, EPA concluded that mining operations would cause losses of streams and wetlands and contamination of the land and water to the detriment of 29 species of fish, 40 terrestrial mammals, and 190 species of birds.  The magnitude of the projected environmental impacts is well documented in EPA's peer-reviewed report, and these impacts would be irreversible. The largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world could be destroyed forever, and the livelihood of those that depend on the salmon could also be destroyed.  EPA should move forward on this PD because it already followed an extensive public process on this matter; it would be a complete waste of government resources to ignore the existing scientific work and its conclusions and begin a new project review process.

The EPA provided opportunities for public comment on two draft scientific assessments, which generated hundreds of thousands of comments. The current proposal to withdraw the PD is wasteful and abusive of the Agency's procedures and its resources.  The EPA followed the Clean Water Act and its procedures.  In fact, EPA went above and beyond the required procedures and offered two draft reports for public comment prior to publishing its final assessment.  Administrator Pruitt, as reported in several newspapers, concluded that the PD should be withdrawn based on meetings with advocates for the Pebble Mine, but the Administrator has offered no information or evidence as to why the existing scientific assessment is flawed. The process to date - with EPA's publication of the Final Bristol Bay Assessment in January 2014 -- was a scientifically valid and legally sound process and compliant with the Clean Water Act. The existing EPA assessment is a thorough and compelling basis for moving forward with the Clean Water Act 404(c) protections.

Dear Mr. Pruitt,

I am writing to express my concern for the Bristol Bay watershed. As someone gravely concerned with ecology, 

The Copper River in late August is full with swarms of spawning red salmon. Everything that lives in the Bristol Bay watershed is derived from and directly dependent on these salmon, including the region's native people, who are as dependent on the fish returning to the rivers in July as they are on the sun rising in the morning.

After review of the executive summary,  I understand that quite literally skinning and gutting an entire watershed, dredging the river deltas and then dumping toxic ore derivatives into the sea will send the salmon and everything that depends on them into virtual free fall. This is what will happen if we proceed. But again, we are dangerously blind to the real fallout, the byproduct if you will of the extermination of another entire ecosystem.

Mr. Pruitt, by allowing passage of this proposal, just like your predecessors, with all that affords us a stable, liveable climate.  If you drop the proposal and let the fish maintain their ancient stabilizing role in the vast circuitry of ocean, stream and atmosphere, you will be affording humankind the most effective insurance policy imaginable in a time of great uncertainty. Please note that I am voicing my desire as a concerned citizen of the United States to protect this watershed and restrict the use of this area for mining or as a disposal site.

Sincerely,

Please put American jobs over mining interests and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.
 
Bristol Bay, Alaska is one of our last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a once-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a Canadian mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine. Although Alaskans typically support resource development, more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents oppose the proposed Pebble Mine. If built, the Pebble Mine would be many times larger than America's current largest open-pit mine and require several large earthen dams to hold back billions of tons of mine waste. This waste would require perpetual remediation and be forever at the headwaters of two of the most productive salmon rivers in the world.

In 2010, frustrated with ineffective and inadequate options for addressing the proposed mine at the local level, Alaska Native Tribes, commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize local communities, American jobs, and the region's thriving economy and culture.

The EPA responded by hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. After years of review and input from Americans, the EPA determined that a large mine of the type and scale contemplated by Pebble would have unacceptable adverse effects on the fish, recreation, and communities in the area, and based on this information proposed several restrictions that any mining in the Pebble area would have to meet.

Over the course of the EPA's own comment and public review processes, the EPA received more than 1.5 million comments asking for strong protections for Bristol Bay. Withdrawing the proposed determination would fly in the face of an overwhelming majority of Alaskans and put the short-term interests of a Canadian mining company above thousands of American jobs.  

Alaskans asked for state-level protections as well as the EPA's involvement and for up-front protections for Bristol Bay's jobs and fisheries. Please do not trade American businesses and jobs and our wild salmon for the shallow promises of a mining company. I am writing today to ask that you stand with American jobs and communities and not withdraw the Proposed Determination.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

RE: Bristol Bay, Alaska/Pebble Mine - Docket: EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369

Dear Administrator Pruitt and Acting Region 10 Administrator Pirzadeh:

I am a Healthcare chef and Food Service Manager, as well as a Slow Food USA supporter, dedicated to a food chain that is good, clean, and fair for all, providing food that meets the nutritional requirements for a healthy America.  I write to urge the US Environmental Protection Agency to protect Bristol Bay, Alaska, from the Pebble Mine that would threaten the region's irreplaceable fish and wildlife resources and the 14,000 jobs that depend on Bristol Bay's clean, healthy waters and fishery.  EPA must keep in place the 2014 Bristol Bay 404(c) Proposed Determination.

At a time when the USDA and FDA are reporting on the need for and benefits of increased seafood consumption in the US -- seafood that is SAFE and SUSTAINABLE, meaning US seafood (not imported) -- destroying any national treasure of local seafood is insane, especially one as important as Bristol Bay. 

According to EPA study, the Bristol Bay watershed provides vital habitat for 29 fish species, more than 190 bird species, and more than 40 terrestrial animals. All five species of Pacific salmonsockeye, Chinook, coho, chum, and pinkspawn and rear in the pristine Bristol Bay watershed. The Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, producing approximately 46% of the world's wild sockeye harvest, creating $1.5 billion in economic output and nearly 20,000 jobs throughout the United States annually.

EPA's scientific study contains highly concerning facts about the proposed Pebble Mine: even without a mine disaster, exploitation of the Pebble deposit will destroy 94 miles of salmon streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, lakes, and ponds. Overall, EPA concluded that mining the headwaters of the Bristol Bay river systems could cause irreparable harm to the valuable Bristol Bay fishery, wildlife, and communities.

I stand with more than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen who oppose the Pebble Mine.  I stand with the USDA and FDA in being a proponent of increased US safe and sustainable seafood consumption for a healthy America, which is impossible without the protection of domestic seafood sources like Bristol Bay. Because of its great, ecological, economic, and cultural value, and importance for the health and well-being of  all Americans, I implore the EPA to stand with us by keeping in place the 404(c) Proposed Determination for Bristol Bay, Southwest Alaska.

Thank you for your attention.

Such a failure would result in the complete loss of any fish habitat that remains.  It is known that the proposed mine will destroy one of the largest wild runs of socket salmon in the world, and would take with it 22 miles of critical river habitat, and over 6 mi. of wetlands.

The EPA decision regarding the Pebble Mine should stand!   Alaska depends on its fishery jobs and the salmon resources of our state's waters. Do not withdraw the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination, which was made under our Clean Water Act.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's and the world's last great wild salmon runs. The annual runs of millions of salmon, support a large number of commercial and sport fishing jobs that keep thousands of Americans and Alaskans employed.  For Alaskans they are an important subsistence resource, for indigenous cultures salmon is a keystone, and for visitors from all over who come to Alaska, it is an amazing experience to still be able to catch salmon.

These are jobs fueled by an important renewable, valuable food resource. We should not risk this resource that can endure into the future to a foreign-owned mining company.  The people of Alaska, roughly 65%, do not support the proposed Pebble Mine.  We support our present and future by taking care of our salmon.

The EPA has done the right thing by making a decision protects Bristol Bay.  This was not an arbitrary decision. They followed the rigorous procedures for public comment, participation, and hearings.  The public responded with over a million and a half responses on this topic.

Please listen to the Alaskans and our fellow citizens in other states who support the EPA decision.

Please do not withdraw the proposed determination.

Growing up in that lifestyle, and continuing to work in commercial fishing has shaped my life in more ways than I can tell here. I frequently talk with people from my fishing community about the shape and meaning, beyond just the obvious economic platform, that salmon have given our lives. 

Fishing for salmon is more than just a economic option. It is a culture, a family tie, a connection to the world, to seasons, to patterns greater than ourselves. When society make decisions, time and time again, that value finite commodities over the reoccurring abundance of wild fish, we cut ourselves off from a gift that has been passed down from generation to generation for thousands and thousands of years. Salmon inform our identity, keep food on our tables, give us social cohesion, send us to school, put roofs over our heads, define our years and keep us participating with this dynamic, changing planet. 

The pursuit of gold and copper, and in particular, the pursuits of the Canadian mining industry, has a TERRIBLE track record all over the globe. Displacement, complete destruction of the environment and the eradication of cultural, regional and familial knowledge and self-determination all have been done at the behest of Canadian-owned mining corporations.

To let one of those companies, proposing one of the largest open-pit mining operations the world has ever seen, to get ever closer to setting up shop upstream of the world's last great Sockeye Salmon resource, is unforgivable. 

Open-pit mining and Salmon habitat do not, have not coexisted with success. We have no examples of success. We do have, however, direct experience with failure-with damage, loss or complete eradication of Salmon habitat and of Salmon. 

DO NOT withdraw the Proposed Determination to Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site for the Pebble Mine. 
To do so would take us all one step closer to killing one of the last great Salmon places on the planet. We have an obligation to ensure that Salmon exist for the security of future generations. 

With basic, thoughtful protections Salmon can last as a source of wealth, nutrition, knowledge and security for generations and generations to come. Mining gold/copper/molybdenum will be a source of wealth for a select few, for a few decades with a mass of toxic wastes that will LAST FOREVER. 

DO NOT withdraw the Proposed Determination to Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site for the Pebble Mine.

When I left Alaska in 2014, I was relieved to know that many of the major investors had withdrawn from Pebble Mine and it seemed the area was safe from mining.

Part of my time in Alaska was spent in Bethel and there was a threat of a large scale gold mine in the area and that was successfully challenged.  The threat the gold mine would have had to the salmon rich waters was understood. Salmon is such lifeblood to areas such as the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and Bristol Bay.  Salmon fishing, both subsistence and commercial have been and will continue to be a valuable industry and food source for Native Alaskans as well as the world.  There is also the deep cultural significance of salmon to the Yu'pik - just as the bowhead whale is to the Inupiat.

I do not understand why Pebble Mine is back on the table.  There is too much at stake to potentially destroy this important watershed.  The fisheries are productive and will benefit the communities and the world for hundreds of years to come.  Not only do the fisheries provide food and jobs, there are also the monies to the state and private business from recreation and tourism.  Also, think about the potential threat to fresh, clean water if a mine of this scale were to contaminate the local area.

Your own agencies, as well as others have stated that mining in Bristol Bay, especially on the scale of Pebble Mine, poses an unacceptable risk on salmon, clean water, and the local economy. Disasters such as the Mount Polley tailings dam spill serve as a cautionary tale of what irreversible damage can happen if such mining is allowed to occur. The fact that Northern Dynasty, one of the few remaining backers of this mine, has very little experience designing large-scale mines is quite alarming.

The data I have seen shows that large-scale mining has the potential to cause irreversible damage to the ecosystem in the Bristol Bay watershed. That is not a risk worth taking. As someone who has lived in Alaska and in a rural community, I know the importance of local resources to the area, both its subsistence and cultural value.  As a secondary science teacher, I want to model the importance of looking at the evidence and speaking out when policies are proposed go against that evidence.  In good conscience, I must speak out on this proposed determination to withdraw the restrictions on mining in Bristol Bay.  One cannot be complacent nor look at short-term profits, when it comes to the health of our world.

I urge you to keep the proposed Bristol Bay 404(c) in place.

Do NOT LIFT RESTRICTIONS on mining in this part of Alaska.

RE: Bristol Bay, Alaska/Pebble Mine - Docket: EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369

Dear Administrator Pruitt and Acting Region 10 Administrator Pirzadeh:

I am opposed to the EPA's decision to withdraw protection of the Bristol Bay Fishery in favor of a planned Pebble Copper and Gold Mine.  Home to the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world, with approximately 46% of the average global stock of wild sockeye salmon, it is crucial to preserve this dynamic ecosystem for the preservation of salmon, as well as for environmental protection.  

The EPA's Watershed Assessment clearly indicated that the requirements of the Clean Water Act need to be invoked in order to protect this precious resource, the Bristol Bay.   This ecosystem of rivers and wetlands and an abundant and sustainable salmon fishery supports local tribal communities, fisherman, and a vibrant seafood system.

The company that will benefit the most from the ability to mine Copper and Gold in Bristol Bay have already held up this decision in the courts.  Please have the courage to require the Pebble Mine developers to comply with restrictions that will protect this large and valuable natural resource by limiting the discharge of dredged or fill material.

Sincerely,
Sandra Moore

When properly managed, wild fish populations provide a sustainable source of food to Americans, and fisheries provide jobs for fishers, processors, and managers. Wild Alaskan sockeye salmon is not only one of the most economically valuable stocks we have in the US (an average of $152 million per year, over the last three years[1]), it is essential to the cultural wellbeing of fishermen and native people in the US. The pristine spawning habitat in Bristol Bay, and the diversity of habitat available, allows this stock to reproduce and remain resilient to environmental conditions [2,3]. Scientific evidence that mining activities would damage this habitat and harm salmon populations is overwhelming [4]. The EPA itself has already evaluated the risks associated with building the pebble mine, finding that habitat loss for salmonids would be unavoidable [5].

In evaluating risk, scientists weigh the potential seriousness of negative impacts against the possibility that those negative impacts will occur. Here, we must also weigh impacts against the potential positive outcomes of a mine: these, however are limited to a short-term economic benefit. Sustainable jobs like salmon fishing and processing may result in less short-term growth, but will provide more consistently for more local people. 

Even if the Pebble mine is smaller and ""cleaner"" than its original plan, there will also be a nonzero probability that some unplanned problem will occur. The potential long-term ecological and economic risks of mining in Bristol Bay are too high to risk any permitting whatsoever. Allowing the Pebble mine to build anything will also set a precedent for the several other mining companies interested in mining in the same area, and the impacts of multiple mining sites are likely to be cumulative [4]. 

One can always cast doubt on the certainty of scientific evidence. The only irrevocable evidence we would have in this scenario would be an absence of sockeye after the construction of a mine, and by that point it would be too late. Just as we concern ourselves with the security of our people, so must we concern ourselves with the security of our ecosystems and our fisheries. Building an extractive mine in the middle of a fragile, wild ecosystem- one which already provides incredibly valuable natural resources- would be an unforgivable mistake.

I strongly support the EPA's WITHDRAWAL of the Proposed Determination against the Pebble Mine Project. 

Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP) has invested $750M+ in good faith. They have followed the law and consistently tried to meet their many regulatory, legal and environmental obligations to the region and the State of Alaska to the highest standards asked and required of them. It is now EPA's turn to also follow the law and act in good faith.

The Pebble Project is on State of Alaska land designated for mineral exploration and development and that land has been the subject of at least two democratically approved land-use assessments by the state which have reinforced and informed PLP's right to invest in, and advance the project.

If the United States prides itself on being governed by the ""rule of law"", then it is imperative that this project be properly evaluated on the basis of the whole record using the legislatively mandated permitting process under the National Environmental Policy Act. During NEPA an Environmental Impact Statement must be completed and this EIS will properly assess all of the impacts that the proposed project may have. It is important to remember three things: 

First, during the legally-mandated permitting process no harm will come to the environment. 

Second, PLP is only asking for the right to prove that their project deserves a permit, not a guarantee that it will be granted. PLP knows that there is a due-process and that they must perform to the well-established standards of the process or they risk failure in their effort to secure the right to proceed. 

Third, as part of the permitting process PLP must prove that it can mitigate whatever impacts its project may have on wetlands and fish habitat. PLP claims that they can indeed mitigate their impacts. The only proper ""rule-of-law"" framework in which to properly assess the validity of their claims is the proven, legally mandated, NEPA process. 

Again, Pebble Partnership is not asking for a predetermination in their favor but an assurance that there will be a fair and transparent vetting of the whole record to evaluate the prospective project based on its merits as governed by the legally mandated NEPA process. For EPA to preemptively deny PLP this legal right to exhaustively make its case, is a clear violation of the principals of fairness, rule-of-law and due process. 

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposal.

Finally,  The US government should be thinking long term about securing domestic sources of raw materials that will be important for clean energy technologies.  Battery technology is going to change the world and allow for cleaner sources of power production.  Mines like Pebble are going to be needed for a cleaner environment.
Sincerely,
Chuck Vitton.

As the EPA you have a huge responsibility to protect the land. The Clean Water Act is an extremely crucial proposal that cannot just be abandoned. We must continue to protect our waters and the ecosystem that thrives within these waters. This is one of the worlds LARGEST salmon runs and by taking away restrictions for the Pebble Mine in Bristol Bay it will negatively affect the already endangered salmon species. 2017 has been the lowest recorded numbers of wild salmon population EVER in history. When the salmon completely disappear it will wreak havoc on an already delicate ecosystem. The wild salmon remain one of the most important factors in the ecosystem of of the North Pacific. With a loss of salmon means a loss of whales, a loss of algae (which feeds other animals and produces oxygen and filters CO2 in the atmosphere), a loss of nutrients in our rivers our soils and thousands of other intricate webs of the food chain. This will directly affect humans and directly affect global warning. It is your responsibility as the EPA to PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT, not to destroy it. Take accountability for the planet, humans and all life on this planet. DO NOT WITHDRAW FROM THIS CRUCIAL CLEAN WATER ACT RESTRICTIONS. If you do you can't call yourself an ""Environmental Protection Agency"".

RE: Bristol Bay, Alaska/Pebble Mine - Docket: EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369

Dear Administrator Pruitt and Acting Region 10 Administrator Pirzadeh:

I have just been informed about the potential to destroy important fish habitat in Alaska.  We have responsibility for the sustainability of wildlife, and I would think that would go without saying in this case since fisheries are important food sources.

I am a supporter of Slow Food USA, the national, not-for-profit organization dedicated to a food chain that is good, clean, and fair for all.  I urge the US Environmental Protection Agency to protect Bristol Bay, Alaska, from the Pebble Mine that would threaten the region's irreplaceable fish and wildlife resources and the 14,000 jobs that depend on Bristol Bay's clean, healthy waters and fishery.  EPA must keep in place the 2014 Bristol Bay 404(c) Proposed Determination.

According to EPA study, the Bristol Bay watershed provides vital habitat for 29 fish species, more than 190 bird species, and more than 40 terrestrial animals. All five species of Pacific salmonsockeye, Chinook, coho, chum, and pinkspawn and rear in the pristine Bristol Bay watershed. The Bristol Bay watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon run in the world, producing approximately 46% of the world's wild sockeye harvest, creating $1.5 billion in economic output and nearly 20,000 jobs throughout the United States annually.

EPA's scientific study contains highly concerning facts about the proposed Pebble Mine: even without a mine disaster, exploitation of the Pebble deposit will destroy 94 miles of salmon streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, lakes, and ponds. Overall, EPA concluded that mining the headwaters of the Bristol Bay river systems could cause irreparable harm to the valuable Bristol Bay fishery, wildlife, and communities.  We can see in many places the effects of mining operations.  Remediation can be done, but the wildlife destroyed is gone.

I stand with more than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen who oppose the Pebble Mine.  Because of its great, ecological, economic, and cultural value, I implore the EPA to stand with us by keeping in place the 404(c) Proposed Determination for Bristol Bay, Southwest Alaska.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

Pat Schroeder

As you know, Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

To protect the Bristol Bay Watershed, the EPA should move forward with its Proposed Determination (PD) under Clean Water Act. Although mining is necessary to support our modern way of life, large-scale mining operations should not be located in the sensitive and unique ecosystems of Bristol Bay. There are two crucial reasons for this:

One, the EPA should act based on the scientific information that it has gathered to support this PD.

The EPA conducted a thorough science-based investigation of the Bristol Bay Watershed and potential impacts from the minig proposals by Northern Dynasty. Based on the projected impacts of a mine far smaller than those proposed to the company's investors, EPA concluded that mining operations would cause unacceptable adverse effects on fish and animal habitats in the Bristol Bay Watershed. There are 29 species of fish, 40 terrestrial mammals and 190 species of birds that would be impacted; in addition to the losses of streams and wetlands and the contamination of the land and water. The magnitude of the projected environmental impacts are well documented in EPA's peer-reviewed report, and these losses will be irreversible. The largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world will be destroyed forever, and the livelihood of those who depend on the salmon will also be destroyed.

Two, EPA should move forward on this PD because it already followed an extensive public process on this matter, and it is a waste of government resources to ignore the existing scientific work and its conclusions and to begin a new project review process.

EPA provided opportunities for public comment on two draft scientific assessments, which generated many hundreds of thousands of comments. The current proposed to withdraw the PD is a waste of public resources, a fraud, and blatant abuse of the Agency's procedures. The EPA followed the Clean Water Act and its procedures. In fact, EPA went above and beyond the required procedures and offered two draft reports for public comment prior to publishing its final assessment. Administrator Pruitt, as reported in several newspapers, concluded that the PD should be withdrawn after meeting with advocates for the Pebble Mine. The Administrator has provided no information or evidence as to why the existing scientific assessment is flawed; in fact, to the contrary, the Administration states that the mining companies should have an opportunity to submit proposals and conduct environmental impact statements and as such, a fair process for moving forward. The process to date - with EPA's publication of the Final Bristol Bay Assessment in January 2014 -- was a fair process and compliant with the Clean Water Act.
The existing EPA assessment is a thorough and legitimate basis for moving forward with the Clean Water Act protections.

Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.

You will be usurping the very civic engagement process that you claim did not occur for the National Monument you are proposing to reduce or delete. Also a short term, extreme bad judgement call on your part. Remember that you work for rhe good of the American public, not large corporations.

Pebble Mine would produce small and short-term payouts to local communities while threatening the land on which they have subsisted for thousands of years. This past year, more than 56 million sockeye salmon returned to rivers within the Bristol Bay, the fourth largest escapement on record. Similarly, commercial harvest was also the fourth greatest on record. The Bristol Bay salmon fishery is the most valuable salmon fishery in the world. Salmon runs in other parts of the world (such as British Columbia, Washington state, Oregon, and California) have been decimated by human activities, often from mining operations. Any mis-step by Pebble could irreversibly shift the Naknek-Kvichak system and the larger Bristol Bay area into a state resembling these other areas, destroying commercial and recreational fishing opportunities, subsistence livelihoods, and the animal communities that are intricately tied to a pristine landscape. Do not allow Pebble Mine to operate. The associated risks far exceed the benefits. Bristol Bay is one of the last untouched wildernesses on the planet. Please do not ruin such a precious area.

I support the EPA's withdrawal of the Proposed Determination of the Pebble Mine Project. In a nation that is governed by the ""rule of law"", it is imperative that this project be properly evaluated using the legislatively mandated permitting process under NEPA, which will allow ""all""  impacts of the proposed project, both pro and con, to be fully vetted. What the Pebble Partnership is asking for is very simple. They are not asking for a predetermination in their favor but assurances that there will be a fair and transparent process to evaluate the prospective project based on the merits as governed by the NEPA process. The Partnership is very aware that after presenting their evidence they may or may not ultimately receive a permit. However, to preemptively deny the Pebble Partnership the ability to present the data and analysis they have exhaustively collected violates the due process clause of the Constitution and in my mind is tantamount to a ""taking"".

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposal.

EPA Proposed Determination to Restrict Use of Area as Disposal Site: Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska; Proposed Withdrawal  ID: EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369-0001

I support the withdrawal, I say no to mining in the Bristol Bay headwaters.  The watershed is home to the world's largest wild sockeye salmon fishery.  I am a consumer of wild sockeye salmon.  I don't want this fishery ruined.  Human forces, whether it be over-fishing or climate change have practically destroyed the Atlantic Salmon fishery.  This fishery supports 50% of the world's commercial supply.  We need to protect the sockeye salmon fishery to the furthest extent.  That means NO mining.  This fishery supports the economy, generating more than $480 million annually in revenue and employees 14,000 full and part time workers.  This is no small economic driver, plus it feeds us.  We can't afford to jeopardize in any manner this fishery.  That means NO mining.

The footprint of this proposed mine is incredibly large, 30 square miles, that's practically twice the size of the rural township in which I live.  The proposed mine will generate ten billion tons of mine waste, require massive amounts of water, earthen dams, 100 mile road, massive power plant and dewater key salmon spawning streams.  Food is necessary for life, gold is not.  That means NO mining!

I do live quite a distance from Alaska however, I am a relevant stakeholder.  I am a sockeye salmon consumer; I currently am a contributor to the Alaskan economy.  I also am a strong advocate for our environment.  I know first-hand how big resource companies come into small communities and ruin them, ruin the water, soil, air along with changing our social fabric and not for the better.  Regulations are never robust enough to prevent unintended, long lasting environmental calamity, disasters and devastation.  We can't allow this to continue.  That means NO mining!

Please accept my comment and withdraw this proposal which is most harmful to sockeye salmon, the Alaskan people and their sockeye salmon consumers.  Thank you for the commenting opportunity.

   Had to read this paragraph several times to note if it was for or against Bristol Bay.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.

I wish to voice my opposition to the proposition to withdraw 
from the Clean Water Act which would then allow mining companies 
such as Pebble Limited to mine the resources in the Bristol Bay
Alaska region. 

The fact that Mr. Pruitt has single-handedly submitted this
proposal is despicable. Since EPA means Environmental
Protection, how does raping the land so that a few can make 
millions protect this environment?  Mr. Pruitt as EPA chief
has been like leaving the fox in charge of the hen house.  


I,m sure that even if the laws which would allow the mining
to proceed are prevented in the current administration, 
the resources within the Bristol Bay are so greatly desired
that this attempt will be made over and over again in the 
future. 

I am so offended by this administrations' environmental
policies so far that the republican party can no longer
rely on my vote or support.

I can't help but think that the opinion of one insignificant voter has 
very little weight and will make no difference. However,
I do believe it is important to constantly remind public
officials that they serve the people (the larger common good) not 
the businesses who will make large sums of money with little
benefit to the country. If anything, this often has a detrimental
affect on the public because they get stuck with having to pay for
the environmental damages as well as having to live in the 
contaminated regions. I also don't support the counter argument which 
always says there are significant overall economic benefits from these 
operations. The so called ""Trickle Down Effect"" only benefits the few 
businesses who are directly involved.

Please starting doing your job to serve the public and protect the environment.

Thanks for listening,

If they find that mining is likely to negatively impact the surrounding ecosystem (which by all indications I am aware of, it will), require the Pebble LP to put off their mining until such time less detrimental methods/technologies are developed. If they are able to mine without much damage, legally bind them to cover any and ALL environmental damage that may result from unseen circumstances.

RE: EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369 

	I vehemently oppose Scott Pruitt's proposal that would allow Pebble Limited Partnership access to the beautiful Bristol Bay region - home to fisherman, a $200 million salmon industry, and its spectacular rivers teeming with aquatic life.
	Why is the EPA continues to tune out voices of opposition and side with lobbyists eager to exploit the wetland in confounds reason. 
	What science backs up Pruitt's proposal? Can he present any evidence to counter the earlier determination based on year of scientific study that the proposed mine would be a risk to both fisheries and the ecosystem? Science is not on his side and apparently did not play a role in his decision. And why is our EPA chief meeting with corporate executive, special interest groups, and lobbyists from the very industries he is supposed to regulate? How can the public trust a man whose office sent letters written by energy industry lobbyists to Obama and other agencies? Why did he spend $25000 on a soundproof booth? 
	The public is left to wonder: Is Scott Pruitt on their payroll as well? 
	When an EPA spokesperson says that the ""EPA has been the poster child for regulatory overreach, the agency is now meeting with those ignored by the Obama administration..."" Really? These companies were not ignored. Pebble filed lawsuits charging the EPA ""colluded with anti-mine activists and environmental leaning scientists in drafting the assessment."" And now the EPA is colluding with them? I assumed the EPA director's job is to protect our environment? According to Section 404(c) the EPA has authority to ""protect the environment whenever it determines unacceptable adverse effects may result from development activities. 
	 What is the basis for the decision? ""Science should be not something just thrown about to try and dictate policy in Washington, D.C.?"" Really? Science should not influence environmental policy? Troubling at least.
	I do not care if Pruitt expresses his own doubts on the cause of climate change. But I do care that every administration since the 1980s has accepted the scientific evidence to protect our planet. 
	More importantly, what else will the EPA chief do with our country?
	Kick the lobbyists out of the halls of government - the administration promised to drain the swamp!
	Fulfill your mission to protect ""human health and the environment... where they live, learn, and work""  it's all we ask. 
	
Sincerely,

Iam opposed to EPAs proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

The rationale for the proposed withdrawal is flawed. Finalizing the proposed determination would provide much more regulatory certainty than withdrawing it, and a permit application is not needed to augment the already detailed factual record.  Further, the proposal to withdraw appears to be a ""sue and settle"" arrangement, which this Administration has said it will not pursue.

The watershed's ecological resources generated nearly $480 million in direct economic expenditures and sales and provided employment for over 14,000 full- and part-time workers in 2009.  The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world.  It is also home to 25 federally recognized tribal governments who have maintained a salmon-based culture and subsistence-based way of life for at least 4,000 years that would be placed in jeopardy.

Contrary to comments by the backers of the Pebble Mine project, EPA's watershed assessment was scientifically based and thoroughly peer-reviewed, and the public has had an extensive opportunity to comment on it. The assessment and public comments received should be key components of any future action on this issue.

The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the project.5  A statewide majority of voters also oppose it, as evidenced by the 2014 State-wide ballot measure.

There is no good reason to withdraw this proposed determination, and many good reasons to proceed to make it a final determination.

Please consider the EPA's own peer-reviewed and well designed report about the potential permanent damages such mining operations could have on the most productive salmon fishery in the US, and its associated $1.5 Billion sustaining industry. A mine is extraction industry, here for a time and then gone. But the impacts can be long lasting. On the other hand, a fishery continues to produce, when well managed. When making these policies, our administration must think long-term, if we are to maintain a healthy economy and healthy environment.

Please consider the more developed thoughts and opinions of my supervisors in the AFS, who wrote this well constructed letter to Scott Pruitt and the EPA : https://fisheries.org/2017/10/afs-objects-to-epas-withdrawal-of-pebble-mine-determination/

RE: EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369 
 
I vehemently oppose Scott Pruitt's proposal that would allow Pebble Limited Partnership access to the beautiful Bristol Bay region - home to fisherman, a $200 million salmon industry, and its spectacular rivers teeming with aquatic life.
Why is the EPA continues to tune out voices of opposition and side with lobbyists eager to exploit the wetland in confounds reason.
What science backs up Pruitt's proposal? Can he present any evidence to counter the earlier determination based on year of scientific study that the proposed mine would be a risk to both fisheries and the ecosystem? Science is not on his side and apparently did not play a role in his decision. And why is our EPA chief meeting with corporate executive, special interest groups, and lobbyists from the very industries he is supposed to regulate? How can the public trust a man whose office sent letters written by energy industry lobbyists to Obama and other agencies? Why did he spend $25000 on a soundproof booth?
The public is left to wonder: Is Scott Pruitt on their payroll as well?
When an EPA spokesperson says that the ""EPA has been the poster child for regulatory overreach, the agency is now meeting with those ignored by the Obama administration..."" Really? These companies were not ignored. Pebble filed lawsuits charging the EPA ""colluded with anti-mine activists and environmental leaning scientists in drafting the assessment."" And now the EPA is colluding with them? I assumed the EPA director's job is to protect our environment? According to Section 404(c) the EPA has authority to ""protect the environment whenever it determines unacceptable adverse effects may result from development activities.
 What is the basis for the decision? ""Science should be not something just thrown about to try and dictate policy in Washington, D.C.?"" Really? Science should not influence environmental policy? Troubling at least.
I do not care if Pruitt expresses his own doubts on the cause of climate change. But I do care that every administration since the 1980s has accepted the scientific evidence to protect our planet.
More importantly, what else will the EPA chief do with our country?
Kick the lobbyists out of the halls of government.
Fulfill your mission to protect ""the human health and the environment... where they live, learn, and work""  it's all we ask.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries.

The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Don't let the Bristol Bay die. I live beside a fishery that was destroyed because of the lack of concern by a large company.

It led to the company ""forgetting"" or just not caring what happened, which in turned destroyed the fishing and will have an impact on this river the rest of time. Now we are trying to reverse the damage done by previous generations but it has come at a great cost. 

This isn't just about the fish though, it's about the families. The families that depend on this bay for their livelihood. The gold and coper mine bringing more jobs? Maybe for a short season, but not for the rest of time. Perhaps, it will bring a few nice paying jobs and a decent amount of money for 4 or 5 years, but gold and copper run out. That's why you don't see masses of people still panning the rivers of California. Copper and Gold don't reproduce as the species in this bay do. 

Don't make a way for this mine to exist! There's no way they can safely dispose of their waste for the rest of time. Even if there was a 2% chance it was possible, That's a risk you should not take.

I am a 4th generation commercial fisherman in Bristol Bay who has been following the Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment process since its inception and hoped it would lead to 404c being implemented as was indicated in the Proposed Determination. I request that the determination not be withdrawn and that dredge and fill material not be allowed to be deposited in the U.S. waters of Bristol Bay, Alaska. 
I firmly believe that the environment where the Pebble Deposit lies would be irreparably harmed by mining development and adversely impact the rich populations of salmon that have a relationship to the area and system in and around the deposit. My fear is that even a small mine plan will not only lead to bigger plans later but open the door for other deposits in the area to be developed, thus displacing sustainable salmon by digging up the watersheds that support them. 
The work of the EPA has been important for conserving what is exceptional and necessary to U.S. citizens and I would ask that it continue to be so by recognizing the value of the Bristol Bay fishery and the threat that large-scale mining poses to its health and future.

Why?  Sound science has ALREADY SHOWN that to do so would be a bad idea. Northern Dynasty Minerals, a Canadian mining company, has no business raping American territories for lucre under the guise of the  Pebble Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of the mining company.  The way in which Secretary Pruitt made the decision to reconsider the ban on mining there, put in place under a LAWFUL act of the previous administration, reeks to heaven.

In 2014, EPA's exhaustive and peer-refiewed studies resulted in a report on Bristol Bay under the Obama administration. The report stated that such a mine would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources in some areas of the bay watershed. In particular, the findings are that about 22 miles of streams and more than 6 square miles of wetlands and other habitats that are important to salmon and other fish would be lost to a large-scale mine and that the losses would be irreversible.

Alaskans don't want it, and neither do their neighbors in the remaining American states.   For example, a 2014 statewide ballot resulted in two-thirds of voters choosing to give the Alaska legislature power to approve or veto large-scale mining projects in the area if the projects threaten fisheries.  that's what this mine would do. More than 80 percent of local residents and 62 percent statewide oppose the mine.

Do the right thing and stick with settled science on this issue.  Save everyone time and money.  Stop it in its tracks now and stick with the existing law that bans mining in that area completely. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I've seen it happen to towns in Maine when a paper mill closes, and it's devastating. At least this can be prevented by not building a mine in the watershed. It is the EPA's job to protect the environment, not give into large corporations who only care about profit. DO NOT ALLOW THAT MINE TO BE BUILT.

The salmon fisheries have already experienced severe decline as a result of warming waters and other pollutants. Further damaging the fishing stock will negatively affect not only the fishing community but all other commercial operations that rely on a strong fishery for their success, including housing, retail outlets, marinas, boat maintenance as well as churches, schools and municipal functions dependent upon the fishing economy. 

Of even greater concern is the fact that local communities depend upon the fish in these locations as a food source. The waters and the fish in those waters will contain an over abundance of the target mineral pebbles. Most area residents eat fish almost exclusively. Studies have shown that chronic ingestion of molybdenum can have serious and long-term health effects, including growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight and can also affect the lungs, kidneys and liver.

Fisheries are only one activity that will experience a negative impact. The minerals that will be deposited in these locations will be detrimental if not poisonous to the marine flora. So humans and animals that consume the plants that have absorbed the minerals from the pebble deposits will be exposed to the same health threats as those posed by eating the fish. 

This proposal is rife with negatives and if adopted will sacrifice the health and economic viability of the residents of the nearby communities to benefit the bottom line of the pebble corporation, whose leadership undoubtedly lives in areas not threatened by such health hazards.

I have spent some of the best and most memorable times of my life in the watershed contiguous to the Pebble Deposit in Southwest Alaska.  It is a wilderness like no other, rich in all that so much of the developed world is not.  I am a fisherman, a hunter, an environmentalist and an educator.  I understand and appreciate many of the issues at play here, but I cannot understand why the EPA would realistically consider granting a permit for the Pebble Mine.  Too much that can never be recovered could be lost to such a decision, and the negligible potential gains in the short-term would be forever overshadowed by the ultimate loss of habitat that would inevitably ensue.  I live in Montana, so I know something about the damage a mine can do to an area or a watershed.  You might even look to the Polley Mine debacle in nearby Canada for the price of short-term thinking and the price of arrogance in the face of mother nature.  Whether the holding ponds of the proposed Pebble project will fail is not a question.  They will.  The only question is when.  And so we are left to ponder what happens when the richest fishery and eco-system in the world is lost to the selfish interests of a self-inerested mining concern.  How and why are we even considering this?  Haven't we been through it before?  Or are we just wafting with the winds of politics so that the current administration can deal a lethal blow to the Clean Water Act.  Of all the things upon which to take a stand, the EPA is going to question the value of clean water?

Perhaps the concerns here are economic, and the EPA is re-evaluating the Pebble site because of the money that might be made from the ore deposits.  I wonder, though, if such profits could hold a candle to the economy that Alaska has built around the desire of sportsmen and women to hunt and fish in the Bristol Bay region.  Mining is transient, with the revenue shared by a few.  The salmon runs - unless the EPA fails to do its job - are perpetual and eternal.  And the livelihood those runs sustain will last generations.  If you take my own case as an example and consider the funds that have been committed as a result to the Alaska economy, you could easily quantify the folly of the Pebble project as a money maker for Alaska.

It is my fervent hope, therefore, that you will deny a permit for a disposal site in the Pebble Deposit area of Southwest Alaska.  Deny it for the people of Alaska, for the wilderness that should remain, for the salmon and the rivers, and for future generations who need to know the treasure of Bristol Bay - not the gold and minerals - but the life and ecosystem that remain unprecedented in our world.  There is no choice here.  I hope you will agree.

This proposal threatens the preservation and continuation of a waterway vital to the health of a key species. Its destruction via the byproducts of the mining process would result in the decimation of the local fishing industry and create cascading destructive effects on ecosystems upstream that depend upon healthy Sockeye Salmon spawning runs. 

The fish in the watershed, and the wildlife that depend on them, are too important to risk in exchange for the mine's economic benefits.
Accidental discharge of process chemicals and byproducts, heavy metals, and acid mine drainage to the environment are realistic concerns in mine design and operation. They are dangerous to fish and other wildlife. Downstream salmon and freshwater fish species are vulnerable to mine-generated pollutants. A threat to the fish would amount to a threat to the regional subsistence lifestyle.
According to the EPA, mining has contaminated portions of the headwaters of over 40 percent of watersheds in the western continental U.S., and reclamation of 500,000 abandoned mines in 32 states could cost tens of billions of dollars.

The short term gains outweigh the long term risks but those risks are severe as this is an earthquake heavy region which is a huge reason this place is risky to mine and increases the difficulty of storing hazardous waste. Groundtruthtrekking.org claimed that earthquake hazards in the area are poorly known, and preliminary plans by the mining company do not prepare adequately for the potential risk. It's too dangerous to mine the region for the ecosystem and the miners.

A recent study of 25 modern large hard rock metal mines compared water quality outcomes with environmental impact statement predictions from the permitting stage. 76 percent (19 mines) of the 25 mines violated water quality standards in releases to either surface or groundwater. In this study ""violated water quality standards"" does not necessarily mean that the mines failed to abide by their permits. When the 15 mines with high acid-drainage, high contaminant leaching potential and proximity to groundwater are considered separately, this number is 93% (14 mines).

Bristol Bay where many local families fish. If the waterway is destroyed, more than half of them their summer revenue from their fishing and teaching jobs.

To make matters worse, the mineral rights and the project are controlled by Canadian, British, Australian and Japanese corporations.
The mine may not provide significant tax revenue to the American state. Due to Alaska's tax structure, oil and gas drilling returns over 20% of resource value to the state and municipalities, fishing returns 1% to 5%, and mining returns approximately 1.5%. However, considering the mine contains over $500 Billion in resources, this 1.5% tax amounts to a maximum of $7.5 Billion in tax revenue over the course of the mine's operation or or $166 million/year or some four times the commercial tax budget in 2011 ($43 million). The annual revenue potential of the mine is yet unknown, and consequently so is the tax revenue to the State.

If this mine goes through: Thousands of jobs will be lost, an entire ecosystem will be destroyed and the world's Sockeye salmon population will be decimated.

Please continue to ensure the wellbeing of this vital waterway by enforcing the EPA region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination.

If the EPA position to block any attempts to mine or otherwise jeopardize Bristol Bay's ecosystem, to include the Salmon, the Water, and all Life and People groups in the region, is reversed, the EPA will have proven itself to be acting in interests which are not for the benefit of the People of These United States, making itself a body of government whose power, while granted by the government that rules, to be effectively null and void.

Further, if the decision to act in this manner is permitted to come to pass, such passage, when considered along with the actions of the Trump administration, in particular, which have been against the benefits of the People of These United States, despite repeated protest and notice from various and many persons from within the body of the People of These United States, will give good cause for the dissolution of the Government of These United States of America, to protect the People to which it was and still is given power by.

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

The language of this proposal is obviously not for the layman.  I understand you are seeking very specific comments regarding the determination and whether to proceed or withdraw.  I also understand the determination to be about restricting development of this area as a disposal site in certain bodies of water (watersheds) near Bristol Bay (Pebble Deposit Area, SW AK).  I believe that the area should be restricted from being used as a disposal site - particularly when there is great risk of breaches to the watershed and the ecosystems such as what happened when a dam breached in Canada at the Mount Polley mine in August 2014. It dumped out 6.5 billion gallons of wastewater destroying part of British Columbia's watershed.  Science and the effects of the humongous drilling of the cavern as a big or larger than the Grand Canyon, and estimated to generate billions of gallons of acid generating waste, should take priority in this decision, not greed at the expense of the fishery, salmon and their eco-system.  These waters are too special and too valuable to offer up to the highest bidder.""

I hope you will base your decision on science, the great inherent risks involved, and restrict this area as a disposal site.  

Thank you,

In my opinion, the aforementioned disposal sites carry extreme risk because the cyanide used to leach gold out of the ore mined will probably leak out of the dams(disposal sites) used to contain the mining waste. Any amount of cyanide will pose a risk to life downstream from these sites: fish, birds, animals -- everything.   And, the risk will be catastrophic if the dams containing the waste fail because then the entire watershed downstream will be destroyed!  NOTE: if the mining company says that dam failures will not occur, don't believe it because such failures have been common in gold mining operations elsewhere in the world.  And, the results of these failures have been disastrous !!!

There is no room for error in this proposed mine because if an environmental disaster occurs, there will be no acceptable cleanup operation. (The affected area will never return to its original state.) So, please DO NOT withdraw the EPA Region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination that was issued pursuant of the Clean Water Act to restrict the use of certain waters as disposal sites for dredged/fill material associated with this mining operation.

Bristol Bay, included in the area of the proposal, is home to half of the world's population of sockeye salmon. It's an incredibly important and unique ecosystem, and the foundation of a fishing industry that employs thousands of people. If a mine were built in this area, the disruption to the ecosystem would be immense. The sockeye salmon would be unable to survive, other plants and animals would die out in turn, and thousands of jobs would be lost. Lifting these regulations is bad for the ecosystem and bad for economic growth.

On top of the habitat destruction of the mine itself, there is no way that the toxic waste of the mine can be safely contained for decades, let alone in perpetuity.  When the toxic waste seeps or spills into the Bristol By watershed, potentially destroys the ecosystem that depends on clean water, Pebble Mine will either leave or declare bankruptcy, abdicating responsibility for the cleanup as so many mining companies have done before them.

If withdrawn, the mine would devastate the surrounding environment with its operations and especially with its waste. Bristol Bay is home to a wide range of salmon, in particular, it contains one of the largest populations of sockeye salmon which would be decimated if this withdraw were to go through. Not only would this harm the environment but it will cost thousands of people their jobs and livelihoods as well as devastate the salmon market. On top of that, there's also the fact that Bristol Bay is near a fault line which would make mining activities extremely dangerous and could potentially pose a risk to those living in the surrounding area. I repeat, do not go through with this withdraw.

How is allowing mining by a Canadian company in Bristol Bay putting America first?  We spent 24 years living in Montana and we saw the damage that mining can do.  Some of the largest super fund sites are there.  We now live in Washington state and we have learned and seen how salmon are struggling to survive.  We live in Anacortes, at one time, it was considered the Salmon canning capital.  Salmon are hard to find and the local orca whales are starving because they can not find enough fish to eat.  Canada and the USA ruined an incredible resource.  

Mining in Bristol Bay is a bad idea and we do not support it.  There are other areas that can be mined. Leave this incredible resource alone. Thousands of people rely on these fish to support their families.  There just are not that many decent fisheries left in the world.  Lead by continuing to protect this one.

Why does this matter to me? I am a life long Alaskan, a Bristol Bay fisherman and Bristol Bay permit owner. The Bristol Bay salmon fishery represents a significant portion of my livelihood. There are upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries in Bristol Bay. Both industries depend on the health of the salmon runs, as do the region's communities. 

The proposed Pebble Mine would severely impact the health of the salmon and cause detrimental harm to the entire region. The mine is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs. 

Please do not withdraw the proposed determination.

The area boasts the world's largest and most valuable wild salmon fisheries. It is unlikely that Pebble Mine will be able to operate in this area without harming the rivers and the salmon that depend on them, and such impacts would be catastrophic to this unique, pristine fishery. Withdrawing this determination would clear the way for a project whose impacts to fisheries and the watershed cannot be adequately reduced or mitigated.
Please consider the EPA report  ""An Assessment of Potential Mining Impacts on Salmon Ecosystems of Bristol Bay, Alaska"" (Report) as you reconsider the Clean Water 404(c) determination. For this report, the EPA conducted a comprehensive, rigorous, professional review incorporating the best available science and addressed every substantive peer-review critique. This Report provides an indispensable resource to inform decision-makers of the costs, benefits, and risks to public salmon resources from proposed mining activities in Bristol Bay. The Report recognizes that Bristol Bay is extraordinary because it produces about half the world's wild Sockeye Salmon supply with runs averaging 37.5 million fish per year. The wild salmon fishery in Bristol Bay has been managed in a sustainable manner since 1884, and was valued at $1.5 billion U.S. in 2010. In addition to Sockeye Salmon, Bristol Bay and the watershed support one of the world's largest remaining wild Chinook Salmon runs and healthy Coho, Chum and Pink Salmon runs. These salmon sustain lucrative commercial and recreational fisheries and provide jobs and food security to 25 rural Alaska Native villages and thousands of people. Bristol Bay represents a rare, unaltered living laboratory where we can learn how healthy salmon ecosystems function. Ensuring that this area remains pristine would allow it to continue to inform salmon rehabilitation efforts in the conterminous U.S. where 40 percent of populations are extirpated from historic habitats, a third of remaining populations are threatened or endangered with extinction. The Report rigorously considered mining risks to salmon and based realistic mine scenarios on plans commissioned by mine proponents, state of the art mining and mitigation techniques. However, a major shortcoming of the Report, in my view, is the unrealistically optimistic and foolish assumptions that no significant human or engineering failures would occur. Given that EPA quantified impacts from developing approximately half of the estimated Pebble ore body and did not quantify additional impacts from port facilities, power generation and transmission, and urbanization and other infrastructure, the assessment of potential impacts is very conservative. Actual impacts would very likely be much greater. The Report estimated development of 6.5 billion tons of the estimated 10.8 billion ton Pebble ore deposit would result in a loss of 94 miles of salmon supporting streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, ponds, and lakes in the mine footprint. Toxic mine waste, leachates, wastewater, and tailings dams (mine waste dumps) should be monitored, maintained, and managed during and after mininginto perpetuity. A tailings dam failure in Bristol Bay would have catastrophic effects on fishery resources. Based on past mining district histories and its location, it is highly likely that damage to aquatic resources from mining would be unavoidable and permanent, and compensatory mitigation and remediation would be insufficient to make up for losses to aquatic habitats. Tailings dams have failed in other areas, such as in 2014, when Imperial Metals Corporation's Mount Polley copper-gold mine tailings dam failed, sending 24 million cubic meters of water and mine tailings downstream into a tributary of British Columbia's Fraser River with contamination reaching previously pristine Quesnel Lake.The facts warrant deep considerationImperial Metals Corporation is an established Canadian mining firm, the mine and tailings dam were built to modern technical standards, the tailings were not acid-generating, and the breach occurred on a sunny summer day, not after an earthquake or a major storm event. The Mount Polley Mine tailings dam was the same type of tailings dam proposed for Pebble Mine, but the Pebble Mine and associated dams are projected to be more than 100 times larger than Mount Polley, will be in a geologically and hydrologically less stable area, and in acid generating rock. Given those facts and the best available scientific information, the potential exists for a more serious catastrophe at Pebble Mine than what is ongoing at Mount Polley. I urge the EPA to use its authority to preemptively prevent elimination/impairment of waters supporting the extraordinarily prolific, sustainable, all-wild Bristol Bay salmon fisheries.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

The mine poses unacceptable environmental risks to the Bristol Bay watershed, including those related to generating 10 billion tons of contaminated mining waste that would have to be stored forever in a seismically active area.  Bristol Bay area residents and Alaskans generally oppose the project by wide margins because of the risk of devastating ecological harm it presents: more than 65 percent of Alaskans, 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents and Native communities, and 85 percent of commercial fishermen oppose the mine.  As originally proposed, the Pebble mine would have been among North America's largest open-pit mines.  Although the company is now asserting it will introduce plans for a smaller mine, given the enormous infrastructure expenditures necessary to construct a mine in the area, including the building of a 100-mile road, power plant, and deep water port, proposals for a smaller project are simply unrealistic; they are neither economically feasible nor unlikely to be pursued.  Thus, the focus must continue to be on the original Pebble proposal.  The project as originally proposed poses a calamitous risk to the ecology of Bristol Bay, threatens the local economy and 14,000 American jobs, poses a danger to Native Alaskan communities, and flies in the face of the wishes of the vast majority of local residents and Alaskans generally.  Under these circumstances, a decision to withdraw the Obama administration's 2014 determination and its proposed restrictions can only be characterized as a handout to the mining industry at the expense of the American people and one of America's last wild places.

Do not withdraw the EPA Region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination that was issued pursuant of the Clean Water Act, to restrict the use of certain waters in the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds in southwest Alaska as disposal sites for dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit, a copper-, gold-, and molybdenum-bearing ore body. This determination was made after years of research by multiple public and private interests as well as solicited input by the American voting public. All of the research and comments showed a stark conclusion that any development of Bristol Bay and its associated waterways, was not in the best interest of this country or the environment. Even former partners of the proposed Pebble Mine venture have abandoned the project as costs have skyrocketed and risks increased each year. 

In 2014, Canada's Mount Polley minewhich, though much smaller, is very similar to the type of mine that Pebble would come to beoffered the world a glimpse at what future could await Bristol Bay if Pebble were built and its tailing dam were to fail. When Polley's tailings dam burst, it released its toxic tailings slurry into Polley Lake, Hazeltine Creek, Quesnel Lake and Cariboo Creek. It has been characterized as one of the greatest environmental disasters in modern Canadian historyflooding nearby waters and wetlands with arsenic, selenium and other heavy metals. Prior to the disaster, Polley was one of the mines that the Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP) had held out as an example of mines and fisheries co-existing. PLP even hired the same engineering firm that Mount Polley hada firm that had rebutted the EPA's findings, stating that dams don't fail. Should the PLP move forward, and the tailings dam fail like Mount Polley, the EPA and the American public will be saddled with one of the largest man-made disasters ever. The Superfund site that would arise would take hundreds of years to clean up, destroying the local economy of Bristol Bay. 

In a time when organizations across the country are desperately trying to save the last surviving runs of salmon in the lower 48 states, one of the worst actions the EPA could take is to permit yet another salmon run be destroyed. Almost half (46%) of the world's salmon harvest each year comes from Bristol Bay. It supports 14,000 jobs and is worth an estimated $1.5 billion annually. And it is the sustaining force behind 4,000 year old native Alaskan cultures that continue rely on Bristol Bay's natural plenty to survive. If left unmolested, that economy can continue to generate money year after year. Whereas the PLP has a lifetime of less than fifty years and will leave the region unable to generate money after the mine has closed. 

Please, for the sake of future generations of Americans, do not allow the PLP to move forward and develop the Bristol Bay area. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

""All of these losses would be irreversible.""

With all the extreme weather and drought we have been experiencing we are far past the point of turning a blind eye. It's time that we start protecting the healthy environments that we have left. If this land is opened to mining it will have an irreversible impact on both the land and life.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.

It certainly should be. But here I am today asking you to 
not withdraw the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination, which was made pursuant to the Clean Water Act in 2014.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. As I understand the proposal,  waters in the bay would be protected by a tailings impoundment created by the biggest dam ever constructed. That impoundment and others would have to hold back 10 billion tons of sulfide waste - sulfuric acid, mercury, arsenic, lead, zinc, cadmium, and other poisons. Because sulfide waste lasts forever, it would have to be contained forever. In a seismic zone prone to major earthquakes!

I live in Colorado. Here we know how ineffective mining companies are at containing toxic waste for perpetuity. The inadvertent release of even a small percentage of toxic waste from the Pebble Mine would make the the Gold King Mine disaster, which spilled 3 million gallons of waste water and tailings including cadmium, lead, arsenic, beryllium, zinc, and copper into the Animas River, seem like a walk in the park on a sunny afternoon.

Speaking of parks, within the area influenced by Bristol Bay's watershed and threatened by the mine are: two national parks; four national wildlife refuges; a national monument; a state park; eight state-protected areas; five critical-habitat areas; two game refuges; a state wildlife sanctuary; three federal Steller's eider critical habitat units; two Western Hemispheric Shorebird Reserve Network sites; and at least eight other sites of equal importance to shorebirds. How much sulfide waste would it take to turn these places of natural beauty into ecological disaster areas? We don't want to find out.

Then there is the question of jobs. The tens of millions of wild salmon that return to Bristol Bay each year support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries. Even a small amount of pollution from the Pebble Mine would be enough to destroy these fishing industries. 

The late Senator Ted Stevens got it right: ""It is the wrong mine for the wrong place.""

Please do not withdraw the proposed determination.

Thank you for considering my comments.

Sincerely yours,

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries.

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

It has been much more isolated from development than many parts of Alaska.  Shoals, sandbars and shallows, along with high winds and the eighth most extreme tides in the world make it difficult for large ships to navigate.  This isolation has allowed fish to maintain their health and abundance.  Bristol Bay is one of the outstanding salmon fisheries left in the world.  Every year salmon fishing, for both commerce and sport, brings about $310 million to Alaska. This flow of healthy food and Alaskan income can continue for the foreseeable future if we don't interfere with it. 

The world's human population is exploding.  This is putting pressure already on our ability to feed all people, particularly the ability to get everyone adequate, healthy protein.  The oil in salmon is well known to be good for the cardiovascular system.  

No one can say for sure how long salmon would last in Bristol Bay if the Pebble Mine goes forward.  Behind a huge dam would be an unlined lake containing 10 billion tons of such toxic chemicals as sulfuric acid, mercury, arsenic, lead, zinc, and cadmium.  Furthermore, there are many other corporately held mine leases in the region that are currently inactive.  If the Pebble Mine's large corporate owners invested in the infrastructure for their mine, it likely would make it possible for smaller companies to become active on their leases.

The salmon might end through relatively slow attrition, as water is diverted to mining operations and impurities flow through the soil into the water remaining in the rivers.  Or it might end suddenly with the collapse of one of the dams holding back the impounded toxic chemicals that are inevitably a by-product of mining.  Either way, a major source of food for the world and income for Alaska will be lost forever.

No one could say it better than Ted Williams in Audubon Magazine, Nov/Dec 2012:

""What possibly could unite these diverse and in some cases adversarial players in outrage and action: 700 businesses; 700 hunting and angling groups; 77 commercial fishing groups; 200 chefs and restaurant owners; the National Council of Churches, representing 45 million people; major newspapers; leading jewelry retailers; and ultra-conservative legislators?
It would be a plan to gouge and hack the Bristol Bay watershed of southwest Alaska with the continent's biggest strip mine.""

Re: Comments on Proposal to Withdraw Proposed Determination to Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska (Docket No. EPA-R10-OW- 2017-0369) 

Dear Administrator Pruitt:
  
On behalf of the members of E2 (Environmental Entrepreneurs), I write today in opposition to EPA's ""Proposal to Withdraw Proposed Determination to Restrict the Use of an Area as a Disposal Site; Pebble Deposit Area, Southwest Alaska"" (Proposed Withdrawal).  

Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2) is a national, nonpartisan group of business leaders who advocate for policies that are good for the economy and good for the environment. Our members have founded or funded more than 2,500 companies, created more than 600,000 jobs, and manage more than $100 billion in venture and private equity capital. 

In September 2014, E2 wrote to your agency in support of EPA's Proposed Determination that established common-sense restrictions on the proposed Pebble Mine in Bristol Bay, Alaska. Nothing has changed since then. Not the facts; not the science; and not the law.

Bristol Bay supports sustainable commercial, subsistence, and recreational fisheries that are the backbone of the region's economy. It is home to the largest wild sockeye salmon fishery in the world; supplies half of the world's wild sockeye salmon; generates $1.5 billion annually, and supports more than 14,000 jobs.  This year, Bristol Bay celebrated the return of almost 60 million salmon. Integral to that extraordinary run is the environmental sustainability of the regionsomething the proposed Pebble Mine would jeopardize.

After conducting a rigorous three-year, twice-peer reviewed scientific study of the potential impacts of large-scale mining on the Bristol Bay region, EPA determined the Pebble Mine would have ""significant"" and even ""catastrophic"" impacts on the region. EPA found that even the smallest mining scenarioa 0.25 billion ton mine (out of over 10 billion tons measured and inferred)would eliminate or dewater at least 4.7 miles of salmon-supporting streams; destroy nearly 24 miles of stream habitat and over 1,200 acres of wetlands, lakes, and ponds; and cause significant streamflow alterations.     

EPA has the unequivocal authority under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act to prohibit, restrict, deny, or withdraw the permitting of dredge and fill projects when EPA finds that the discharge ""will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas), wildlife, or recreational areas."" 

EPA assessed the impacts of three mine sizes, and found that even the smallest one would have ""unacceptable adverse effects""the regulatory threshold for 404(c) action. Its Proposed Determination, therefore, applies only to mining proposals of at least 0.25 billion tons, and would allow smaller mining projects to be considered through the standard Army Corps permitting process. This is a sensible approach that places fishand the fishing economyfirst in Bristol Bay.  

EPA has offered no viable rationalebased on facts, science, or lawfor changing its position and withdrawing the Proposed Determination.

As EPA itself acknowledged, Pebble can absolutely submit permit applicationsand the Army Corps can review those permit applicationseven if the Proposed Determination remains in place.  The only uncertainty (or delay) remaining is that brought by the Pebble Partnership itselfby failing, for over a decade, to submit permit applications as repeatedly promised. As Senator Lisa Murkowski wrote: ""At least as far back as . . . 2004, [Pebble] asserted that the submission of permit applications was imminent."" Yet after over a decade of waiting, ""it is anxiety, frustration, and confusion that have become the norm in many communities..."" 

For the good of the economy and the environment in the region and beyond, I urge EPA against needlessly adding additional anxiety to the Bristol Bay region by withdrawing the Proposed Determination. Instead, please keep the Proposed Determinationwhich would protect salmon-supporting waters around the Pebble depositin place. Please prioritize preserving the jobs that the Bristol Bay fishery supports over furthering the interests of a foreign mining company. And please bring long-awaited certainty to the business owners and operators who depend on Bristol Bay's clean water and salmon.

Sincerely,

Bob Keefe
Executive Director

Putting the world's most intact and productive salmon ecosystem in danger to mine is irresponsible and brings into question what the current administration values in natural resources. There have been myriad examples of tailing pond and waste site failures that have resulted in massive amounts of pollution and contamination to the watersheds they are located in. The Mount Polley mine failure in August of 2014 is what will happen to the Bristol Bay watershed if the Pebble mine is approved.  This I am certain of. Do not allow the mining wastes anywhere near the Bristol Bay watershed, it will eventually destroy the aquatic ecosystem as we currently know it. If the Pebble Partnership would agree to transporting the wastes to a less-ecologically sensitive area that is engineered to a higher level of security (think concrete lined ponds, away from ANY surface water) that would be potentially acceptable. However, waste disposal in the Bristol Bay watershed is an unacceptable risk.

The Bristol Bay salmon fishery can not be replaced or replicated.  It is the premier wild salmon fishery in the world, bar none. Stop reading these comments and go to youtube and search for Bristol Bay sockeye. Look at the images and imagine being on the shores of those rivers and lakes. Those animals have a right to live just as you and I do. Those animals are our food. Those animals are the lifeblood of that regions ecosystem. When the Pebble tailings and mine wastes escape the engineered containment sites all of that life and that ecosystem will be forever changed and primarily exterminated. Salmon and pollution do not mix. Salmon and human development do not mix. Period. 

It is my opinion that the EPA should not revoke, reopen, re-examine or in any other way re-visit the decision to deny the Pebble Mine to use ANY watershed in the Bristol Bay region for mine tailings or mine wastes. It is at best irresponsible and we would be simply waiting to repeat history. The Mt. Polley failure will happen in Bristol Bay if the Pebble Mine is allowed. I am certain of that. Don't let that happen on our watch. Start valuing natural resources over money. You can't eat money. Salmon are delicious. 

Lastly, the Environmental Protection Agency's mission is to ensure :""all Americans are protected from significant risks to human health and the environment where they live, learn and work; national efforts to reduce environmental risk are based on the best available scientific information; environmental protection is an integral consideration in U.S. policies concerning natural resources, human health, economic growth, energy, transportation, agriculture, industry, and international trade, and these factors are similarly considered in establishing environmental policy"". Evaluate that mission statement in terms of this proposed mine and waste disposal. I can find only a few benefits from allowing waste disposal in the Bristol Bay watershed and they are all financial, there will be little job creation, there will be little economic growth, there will be little international trade. I see many risks; specifically to Americans living, working and learning in the Bristol Bay watershed. The water will be at risk with toxic mine wastes in the watershed, the salmon and natural resource economy will be highly endangered. The profits generated for a foreign based mining company will be a drop in the bucket compared to the annual economic production of the salmon ecosystem of Bristol Bay. Don't let history repeat itself, learn from the mistakes humans have previously made. Mining and salmon do not co-exist; salmon always lose. Don't let that happen here and now. The Bristol Bay salmon ecosystem is too important and the only intact wild salmon ecosystem left. Don't keep destroying nature, we depend on it for our lives.

Subject: Preserve Bristol Bay

Please DO NOT withdraw the proposed determination to adopt restrictions protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon.
We must speak up and do whatever it takes to protect our earth, it's animals and our precious ecosystem.  After years of scientific studies and local communities participation the EPA found that the Pebble Mine would have significant negative and irreversible effects on one of our most valuable ecosystems in North America.  Bristol Bay is a major fishing area for commercial fishing which supports the communities and provides thousands of jobs.  It is also a traditional Native way of life that has been around for hundreds of years. 

 How can you just throw away those studies and the EPA decision made in 2014? Nothing has changed since then except we have managed to destroy more of our ecosystems.  We all must take a stand to assure a future on this earth for our children and their future children. I am begging the  EPA to stand by its proposed determination and do whatever actions it needs to take to protect the Bristol Bay watershed.

Please do not reverse the determination that the Pebble Mine poses to too great a risk to the Bristol Bay ecosystem and it's fishery to be considered. For four generations my family has fished for salmon from the shore of our family cabin on Whidbey Island. Now my children want to do the same, but the fish are fewer now as the salmon struggle for survival in the waters of Puget Sound. Unfortunately, our wild salmon in Washington State are threatened from years of bad management by an agency more interested in industry interests than the long term sustainably of this valuable resource. When will we stop putting industry interests before the needs of American citizens?  The Bristol Bay fishery has been the exception: it has been sustainably managed since humans inhabited the region. It is the jewel of the Pacific Northwest and provides thousands of  jobs.  

The proposed construction of this mine is an ecological nightmare and a short-sighted economic mistake. Bristol Bay provides thousands of jobs and millions of dollars annually to the U.S economy; the resource is 100% renewable. These impressive figures do not include great benefits to society from an intact ecosystem and maintenance of a resource with substantial cultural and spiritual importance. Pebble mine may provide short-term economic benefit, but long term this is a foolish mistake from an economic, ecological, social, and historical perspective. 

Construction of this mine risk's the preservation of our world's last great salmon fishery. We cannot risk the loss of something this priceless. Our nation has destroyed nearly every other salmon fishery in the lower 48, and the loss of this great fishery would forever erase a livelihood that has defined the Pacific Northwest since history was first recorded in this region. Please understand the basic economics behind this: Pebble Mine may result in some short-term economic benefit; however, the long-lasting nature of its toxic legacy will inevitably destroy our last renewable salmon fishery, worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Do not repeat history and do not ignore the long-term economic benefits of protecting Bristol Bay form short-sighted corporate demands. It may be our last hope to sustain this resource for future generations.

Administrator E. Scott Pruitt Dear Administrator Pruitt,

There are so many things wrong with this. It is horrifying that you are tapping this region of Alaska for fossil fuels, instead of creating clean energy. You are destroying pristine habitat in one of the last remaining wild places in North America. You are leaving this destruction for our children to clean up. When will the greed end?

I write in support of the communities of Alaska's Bristol Bay and ask you not to withdraw the proposed determination to adopt restrictions protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon.The proposed determination was made at the request of local communities and adopted only after years of rigorous scientific study, public participation and peer review. The EPA was correct in 2014 when it found that the Pebble Mine would have ""significant and unacceptable adverse effects"" on ""one of the most productive,pristine, valuable and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America today.""

The EPA has noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300 million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon, generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon support not only the commercial and sportfishing industries, but a traditional Native way of life that has endured for millennia and thrives today.

I just recently returned from a hunting trip to Bristol Bay area (Egegik) and was left with a feeling of awe surrounding this truly wild place. Walking across a river and feeling the salmon bounce of your leg on their journey upstream is something not commonly fealt anywhere in the world OTHER than Alaska. Watching Brown Bears fish, wolves patrolling the edges of the tundra and lovesick moose calling from their hidden place in the willows was an experience I will never forget and one I hope to share with my son some day...mining these wild lands for profit is nothing short of a travesty...

The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and take all necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed.

'The fish only go up 50 to 75 miles to spawn. The mine tailings will be 100 to 150 miles upstream.' I so wanted to say, And if there is a leak, the water containing the heavy elements will not flow downstream?' but I couldn't think how to say that without sarcasm. 

Here is a poem I wrote, and am reading at public events where I've been invited to read some of my writings.

To Make Me Angry, by Abigail B. Calkin

To make me angry
Tell me earthquakes take right angle turns
Tell me earthquakes do not occur within the Ring of Fire
Tell me tailings or slimes, leach residue or gangue
stop before they reach spawning grounds. 
Tell me these waters will contain no trace minerals 
after you greedy pebbles mine the muskeg. 
Tell me Kvichak River has a gate that stops the gangue
from ever entering the spawning grounds. 
Insure us for the millions of dollars of fish lost each year,
each year for 500 years. 
Insure us for the boats of Bristol Bay that crumble in decay.
Insure us for these boats that will resemble
Caspian Sea skeletons
beached and bedraggled relics of land, life, and livelihood
lost to the tides of foreign grubbers. 

Three-fourths of hundreds of years of sustainable jobs will drown
in favor of tens of jobs for thirty years of mining. 
Miners compare these lands to Elko, Nevada. Folks, 
Elko is flat and dry with four percent marsh where wells 
can be a thousand feet deep.  
From Iliamna to the head of Bristol Bay it's muskeg, a bog, a swamp
where square miles of water lie on the surface. 
Do not compare mining Elko to mining Iliamna.
Do not tell me tectonic plates don't move
Do not tell me there will be no volcanoes, no earthquakes
Do not tell me your manmade earthen dams will hold
for a thousand years.  
Do not steal centuries of fish for decades of metal.

Alaskans are deeply connected to the land and this area is one of the last Wild places left in our country and the world at large.

This action to recind is in direct conflict with the word Protection in the EPA.

Along with many other patriotic citizens, I am opposed to EPAs proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

You will be stripping jobs from fishermen and associated businesses. This is no way to make America Great, suckering up to private financial interests and those of your friends. As Trump would say, It Is Disgusting!

 Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans, and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

I'm concerned for the environmental and economical impacts (by impacting the largest salmon run in the world in Bristol Bay) that mining endeavors and other intensively polluting industries would have on the safety of our water, oceans, and on our food source of the salmon & other sea life. We need regulations in place to protect the health & safety of the water & environment which directly impacts the health & safety of our families and communities. It's the job of our government to have the protection, health and safety of the people and the land & water we live on at the forefront of our policy making decisions - not having the short-term monetary benefits of helping large corporations destroy local communities, which are the only ones who would benefit from withdrawing the Clean Water Act for Bristol Bay. 

The significance of this decision will have an impact for many generations to come, with consequences that could effect not only the fishing industry, but also the survival of wildlife populations, the health of the ocean (which stretches beyond our US borders and effects everyone internationally), and the threat of our survival. Time and time again, we've seen that increased mining and the consequent industrial pollution that contaminates the surrounding area is NOT an intelligent course of action for the health of the environment and the local communities that depend on the land they live upon. We are in a critical time where we need to be focusing efforts on reducing every possible avenue that contributes to polluting the land, water, air - ultimately all of which are contributing to climate change, which directly effects our potential for survival on this planet.

We can live and survive with a restricted amount of gold and copper! Btw there are substitutes for those metals in most applications and a better recycling system for retrieving those metals from existing landfills would be more useful for America than digging on pristine and protected/fragile areas!

I strongly support the EPA's WITHDRAWAL of the Proposed Determination against the Pebble Mine Project. 

Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP) has invested $750M+ in good faith. They have followed the law and consistently tried to meet their many regulatory, legal and environmental obligations to the region and the State of Alaska to the highest standards asked and required of them. It is now EPA's turn to also follow the law and act in good faith.
 
The Pebble Project is on State of Alaska land designated for mineral exploration and development and that land has been the subject of at least two democratically approved land-use assessments by the state which have reinforced and informed PLP's right to invest in, and advance the project.
  
If the United States prides itself on being governed by the ""rule of law"", then it is imperative that this project be properly evaluated on the basis of the whole record using the legislatively mandated permitting process under the National Environmental Policy Act. During NEPA an Environmental Impact Statement must be completed and this EIS will properly assess all of the impacts that the proposed project may have. It is important to remember three things: 

First, during the legally-mandated permitting process no harm will come to the environment. 

Second, PLP is only asking for the right to prove that their project deserves a permit, not a guarantee that it will be granted. PLP knows that there is a due-process and that they must perform to the well-established standards of the process or they risk failure in their effort to secure the right to proceed. 

Third, as part of the permitting process PLP must prove that it can mitigate whatever impacts its project may have on wetlands and fish habitat. PLP claims that they can indeed mitigate their impacts. The only proper ""rule-of-law"" framework in which to properly assess the validity of their claims is the proven, legally mandated, NEPA process.  

Again, Pebble Partnership is not asking for a predetermination in their favor but an assurance that there will be a fair and transparent vetting of the whole record to evaluate the prospective project based on its merits as governed by the legally mandated NEPA process. For EPA to preemptively deny PLP this legal right to exhaustively make its case, is a clear violation of the principals of fairness, rule-of-law and due process. 

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposal.
Sincerely,
Doug Allen

It is my understanding that the PLP wants to store mining waste from processing gold and copper ore, in a pristine watershed in Bristol Bay, Alaska; home to the most productive wild sockeye salmon fishery in the world.  This mining waste would be stored in a seismically active zone, forever, behind a human engineered structure.  Engineers can never be sure about the stability of their structures under future circumstances, and there are multiple instances where tailings dams have failed in other parts of the world.  These previous engineering failures would not make the failure of the PLP tailings dam a one off, impossible to believe occurrence.  What I would like the PLP to consider, is transporting the mined material offsite to process, and therefore store the waste in an environment where the failure of the containment system would not be so environmentally damaging as destroying an entire fishery.  In the cases where the dams in other parts of the world (eg Brazil) have failed, massive die-offs of the fish in the affected rivers were observed.  This would be the immediate concern, but the damage to the habitat that supports such a large, renewable, sustainable means of feeding people in the world would be unthinkable.  56.5 million salmon (2nd highest amount in the last 20 years) returned to Bristol Bay this year (2017); if the proposed determination is withdrawn, that number could decrease to zero.  The mined resource is valuable, but the salmon in this case are more valuable, and I do not believe that PLP should be given the chance to meddle in this pristine habitat.  It is much easier to prevent something, then try to restore and fix it once damage has occurred.  Pebble has promised some jobs during the construction of the mine, but eventually, fewer people will be needed for daily operations, so the long term effect on the rural Alaska economy will not be as great as promised.  These temporary jobs will also come at the potential expense of 14,000 fisherman/processing/transport/supplier jobs related to the fishery that happens in Bristol Bay EVERY SUMMER.  We are able to eat high quality, nutritious, sustainable fish from this area, with no inputs to the system.  EVERY SUMMER fisherman go out to fish, and EVERY SUMMER there are fish.  This will keep happening for centuries to come if we continue to preserve and prioritize the pristine habitat that is the headlands of the Bristol Bay watershed.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, supports the world's largest and most valuable salmon fisheries and is one of America's last sustainable wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. Pebble Mine is a threat to local economies and our country's natural resources.

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs. 

Please protect Bristol Bay and do not withdraw the proposed determination.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

While mining is necessary to support our current lifestyles, large scale mining operations should not be located in the sensitive and unique ecosystems of Bristol Bay. There are two compelling reasons for this:

First, EPA should move forward using the scientific information that it has gathered to support this PD.
The EPA conducted a thorough, multiyear scientific investigation of the Bristol Bay Watershed and potential impacts from the proposal(s) by Northern Dynasty to mine the Pebble Deposit. Based on the projected impacts of a mine far smaller than those proposed to the company's investors, EPA concluded that mining operations would cause unacceptable adverse effects on fish and animal habitats in the Bristol Bay Watershed.  Consider the 29 species of fish, 40 terrestrial mammals and 190 species of birds that would be impacted; the losses of streams and wetlands; and the contamination of the land and water.  The magnitude of the projected environmental impacts are well documented in EPA's peer reviewed report, and these losses will be irreversible. The largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world will be destroyed forever, and the livelihood of those that depend on the salmon will also be destroyed. I worked in the Bristol Bay fishery over 40 years ago. Through careful management the fishery exists today and will continue to provide jobs well into the future. Although a reduced size mining proposal has been offered, there is no guarantee it won't be enlarged. Subsequent to working in Alaska, I worked on the cleanup of abandoned mines in the western United States, I have seen the environmental destruction caused by the waste left behind and lack of long term management of these wastes. The Bristol Bay watershed is too important to the world's salmon supply to allow a mine to go forward in this sensitive watershed.

Second, EPA should move forward on this PD because it already followed an extensive public process on this matter, and it is a complete waste of government resources to ignore the existing scientific work and its conclusions and to begin a new project review process.

 EPA provided opportunities for public comment on two draft scientific assessments, which generated hundreds of thousands of comments. The current proposed to withdraw the PD is essentially waste, fraud and abuse of the Agency's procedures and its resources.  The EPA followed the Clean Water Act and its procedures.  In fact, EPA went above and beyond   the required procedures and offered two draft reports for public comment prior to publishing its final assessment. Administrator Pruitt, as reported in several newspapers, concluded that the PD should be withdrawn after meeting with advocates for the Pebble Mine. The Administrator has provided no information or evidence as to why the existing scientific assessment is flawed; in fact, to the contrary, the Administration states that the mining companies should have an opportunity to submit proposals and conduct environmental impact statements and as such, a fair process for moving forward. The process to date - with EPA's publication of the Final Bristol Bay Assessment in January 2014 -- was a fair process and compliant with the Clean Water Act. The existing EPA assessment is a thorough and legitimate basis for moving forward with the Clean Water Act 404(c) protections. 

Thank you for consideration of these comments.

I am writing in regards to the potential withdrawal of the previously proposed determination to restrict the Pebble Mine's use of the Bristol Bay watershed as its disposal site. By withdrawing this determination, the EPA will be undoubtedly exposing one of the worlds greatest migrations of a wild species to an immense risk. And consequently disregarding the livelihood of the thousands of people who rely on this migration for their wellbeing and prosperity. 

When exploring the success of Pacific Salmon throughout the western coast of the United States, it is clear that human involvement in the area has significantly reduced the size and strength of Salmon migrations in California, Oregon, and Washington. This being simply due to the disturbance caused by human infrastructure and presence in an ecosystem; regardless of the occurrence of large scale polluting events due to infrastructure failure. However, with little human disturbances at hand, Alaska's Salmon runs remain in a primitive state providing the entire world with one of the last wild sources of consumer food products. Protecting this fragile ecosystem from human intervention is vital in insuring the presence of the species for generations to come

Secondly, a major selling of the point of the Pebble Mine is the employment that it will bring to the area. While true, this creates a major friction point in my opinion. By allowing Pebble Mine to operate in this area, you are simply holding the jobs of mining workers and those profiting off of the unprecedented volume of geologic material to a higher importance than those involved in the fishing industry and who have been living off of the products of the land for centuries. 

As both a research scientist in Earth's systems and resources and a commercial fisherman, I can not in words express my grave concern of the consequences that will result from the withdrawal of the original proposed determination. I there for ask the Environmental Protection Agency, as a voice to the prosperity of our nations wild places, to stand for the ecological success of this impeccable watershed instead of simply seeing its products as a momentary value worth taking.

I am here to tell you that the creation of the Pebble Creek Mine, one of the world's largest proposed copper mines, would mean the utter destruction of one of the world's largest wild salmon runs. Destroying this population is a fact that 3 years of scientific data showed would happen if a 404 permit to release waste water from the mine is granted. Copper destroys the salmon sense of direction and ""smell"". That is scientific fact. Creating the worlds largest open pit mine would put a nail in the largest sockeye salmon runs. 13 tribes opposed the creation of the Pebble Creek mine because over 14,000 workers would be unemployed from the collapsed industry. Alaska's native salmon runs would collapse and lead to economic disaster.

The EPA administrator reversed the injunction without even reading the scientific reports on the effects of the mine. Do not withdraw the proposed determination to restrict use. Doing so will destroy 56 million sockeye salmon and a way of life for Alaskans.

I've lived in Dillingham for 2.5 years, but I've opposed Pebble from afar for more than a decade. I was excited to move to a place where people fought to protect salmon, and where we believed that the federal government was willing to listen to Tribes and take a stand in favor of protecting wild salmon, pristine lands, and the cultures that rely on them. I was excited to move to a place where I believed the salmon would keep returning, just as they always have.

But this year, when the EPA moved to withdraw the protections, some of that excitement was taken away. Because EPA's move could open up Bristol Bay to be just another mining district. Another place where the federal government has ignored its trust responsibility to listen to the people, instead favoring foreign mining companies. PLEASE CHANGE THIS COURSE OF ACTION.

Bristol Bay is America's last great wild salmon fishery. Annual returns of tens of millions of wild salmon return to support more than 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries. They are the cultural cornerstone for the region's Yup'ik, Dena'ina, and Alutiq indigenous peoples, whose salmon-based cultures have thrived in Bristol Bay for thousands of years. Over half the world's wild sockeye salmon supply, an indigenous way of life, and long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from the foreign-owned proposed Pebble Mine. 

Please do not withdraw or rescind the Proposed Determination for Docket EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369. Instead, please finalize the protections for the last great wild-sockeye salmon fishery on the planet.

I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed withdrawal of the EPA in the Bristol Bay Area.  I am a fisheries biologist and have extensively studied aquatic sciences for years, so please take my comments with sincerity and credibility. 

The most important part of understanding ecosystems is understanding that everything within the food web is connected either directly or indirectly, and a minor disturbance or introduction of a contaminant (for example, sediment runoff from mining) could cascade through the food web with catastrophic effects. If a river system becomes contaminated by heavy sediment, it will fill in and destroy valuable spawning habitat for several fish species. If those species can't reproduce, their numbers will decline rapidly, and another species that depends on those species for food will also die out. Chances are, there is another species that needs that species that died out from starvation, and so on. Eventually mining contaminants will at some point negatively affect the salmon, which happens to be a VERY important food source and income source for the majority of people in that area. That is just one example of the cascading effects. I am not writing to give an entire ecology lecture, but I do want to stress that protecting this area from mine contaminants could protect way more than just some random tiny fish that most people have never heard of nor care about. 

The majority of people don't seem to understand or care about a problem until it is directly in their backyard, and the way we prevent those problems from happening is by starting with the small things like protecting clean water. By doing so, we save peoples' food sources, way of life, and income, not to mention the extensive list of fish and wildlife species that depend on Bristol Bay for survival. This is an issue bigger than ourselves, and we need to take action to protect what truly matters.

Thank you for your time.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

There is overwhelming scientific evidence indicating that the development of this mine, even on the smallest scale that the Pebble partnership has proposed, would be drastically harmful to the sockeye salmon runs of Bristol Bay.

Regarding the decision to withdraw the restrictions, Tom Collier, the CEO of the Pebble Partnership, said that ""It's not a science decision, its a process decision."" I disagree. I think that it is naive and grossly irresponsible to make a decision this large without consulting an unbiased group of scientists. 

There is not a tradeoff with the results of this decision, whether the salmon runs remain intact or the mine is completed are mutually exclusive. If the Pebble mine is developed the sockeye salmon runs and pristine landscape of Bristol Bay will cease to exist as we know it. Do not withdraw the restrictions.

Ask Canada, a country with a depth of experience dealing with extractive industry.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Polley_mine_disaster

The Mount Polley mine disaster is an environmental disaster in the Cariboo region of central British Columbia, Canada, that
began 4 August 2014 with a breach of the Imperial Metals-owned Mount Polley copper and gold mine tailings pond, releasing
its water and slurry with years worth of mining waste into Polley Lake. Imperial Metals had a history of operating the pond
beyond capacity since at least 2011. The spill flooded Polley Lake, its outflow Hazeltine Creek, and continued into nearby
Quesnel Lake and Cariboo River.

.... a ""slurry of toxic water and mud"" continued to pour into the once pristine Quesnel Lake, the cleanest deep water lake
in the world. By the end of the day the four square kilometres sized tailings pond was ""virtually empty"". Mine safety experts
and media articles have called the spill one of the biggest environmental disasters in modern Canadian history.

Anyone who says this won't/can't happen with Pebble is a liar or a fool.

October 17, 2017

Dear Mr. Pruitt,

I cannot comprehend any reason on earth that justifies destroying irrevocably the pristine natural resource that is Bristol Bay, Alaska. Bristol Bay's preservation free of industry and pollution is crucial to the continuing health, for generations to come, of our people, our environment, our water, the wild Alaska salmon whose spawning ground is located here and the thriving industry that depends on this wildlife

What is it that you are going to gain that is so valuable to you that it warrants this nuclear-grade level and scope of annihilation of such a treasured, useful and healthily productive area of our environment?

And consider, as a food source, the wild Alaskan salmon who spawn here.  Pregnant women need to eat a substantial amount of Omega-3 fats (found in wild salmon) which is crucial to infant brain development. Wild Alaskan salmon is an excellent, dependable source of this nutrient that is vital to the continuing health and well-being of generations of Americans to come. I have deep and grave concerns that my grandchildren and their children may not be able to eat confidently anywhere in this country, knowing that their food sources and their water supplies are free of manufacturing toxic runoffs

At the present time, not only pregnant women but all of us are cautioned not to eat Atlantic salmon. Why?  Because it's already polluted by mercury from manufacturing toxin runoff!  

Is this a reasonable trade-off? A perpetually contaminating mine and additional income to the owners of the Pebble Mine versus the health of the American people and their environment--for the ages?  

I say no contest. Cancel the Pebble Mine deal, save the environment and our health, and be remembered as a visionary patriot who took the long view on behalf of our country and all who of us who live here.

Please restore the restrictions  previously set in place to protect Bristol Bay from any mining. I thank you for reading my comment.

Sincerely,

DO NOT withdraw the July 2014 Proposed Determination at this time for the reasons stated for commenting; and if a final withdrawal decision is made following this comment period, the Administrator should ABSOLUTELY review and reconsider the withdrawal decision.

FURTHERMORE, please protect Alaska's water, air, and its wildlife ((( SALMON ))). Protect its land and its indigenous people. They are worth more than any resources ( - gold, -copper, and molybdenum-) you or any company could extract knowing you harm Alaska's waters and salmon fisheries in the procces. Be conciouse of the choice you are making. It took millions of years and even billions of years for the symbiosis of plants and animals to exist on our planet.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries.

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

Dear Administrator Pruitt,
The environment in Alaska is growing more fragile every year. This is a
pristine area and should remain so. Lives and wildlife depend on this
remaining an area free of toxins that come along with mining.
I write in support of the communities of Alaska's Bristol Bay and ask
you not to withdraw the proposed determination to adopt restrictions
protecting the habitat of Bristol Bay's world-renowned salmon.
The proposed determination was made at the request of local communities
and adopted only after years of rigorous scientific study, public
participation and peer review. The EPA was correct in 2014 when it
found that the Pebble Mine would have ""significant and
unacceptable adverse effects"" on ""one of the most productive,
pristine, valuable and vulnerable ecosystems remaining in North America
today.""
The EPA has noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300
million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon,
generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon support not only the commercial
and sportfishing industries, but a traditional Native way of life that
has endured for millennia and thrives today.
The EPA should stand by its proposed determination and take all
necessary actions to protect the Bristol Bay watershed.

Sincerely,

Michael Andrew Taylor

I oppose the withdrawal of this Clean Water Act (CWA) Proposed Determination. I dispute the EPA Administrator's rationale to withdraw the CWA proposed determination, a decision that hinges upon providing Pebble Limited Partnership, a foreign owned company, the opportunity to submit a permit application to Army Corps without having an open and unresolved section CWA 404(c) review.The CWA 404(c) review should be completed first, so that Bristol Bay is properly protected before mine permits will be considered. 

Truly, the CWA proposed determination should be reviewed and finalized. Restricting mine waste disposal in the Pebble Deposit will ensure the protection of the Bristol Bay watershed, which is worth far more to U.S. citizens as a protected sockeye salmon fishery than it could ever be worth as a gold-copper mine. Evidence of risks the sockeye salmon fishery are reported in the EPA 2014 peer-reviewed study An Assessment of Potential Mining Impacts on Salmon Ecosystems of Bristol Bay, Alaska. As a citizen stakeholder with science expertise, I concur with the assumptions and methods used in EPA's ecological risk assessment. It is my opinion as a scientist and U.S. citizen that the findings of this study, especially that disposal of mine tailings in the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds jeopardizes the sockeye salmon population health, are sufficient evidence to justify use of the Clean Water Act to restrict the deposit of mine waste in these waters. 

It cannot be emphasized enough that this CWA proposed determination does not outright ban mining in the watershed. If a mining company intends to pursue development of the Pebble Deposit, the company has full capacity to determine alternative waste disposal options! Thousands of Americans rely on the ecological resources of Bristol Bay watershed for their economy, livelihood, and culture- personally, I am a consumer of salmon products and hope to have sockeye salmon available throughout my life and for generations to come. Additionally, I present the Milltown Reservoir/Clark Fork River Superfund Site as an example of how improper protection of a fishery from mine tailings dam can cost the American taxpayers millions of dollars, and it takes decades of investment to recover lost fisheries (https://semspub.epa.gov/work/08/1570716.pdf ).

Before any mine permitting process proceeds, I insist that the EPA Region 10's CWA proposed determination is justly reviewed, preferably finalized, and of course, NOT withdrawn.

Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.

Of all the heinous, nefarious, cruel, short-sighted, money-grubbing policies and people in this sinister administration, let the world know that Scott Pruitt is the cruelest, meanest, most widely hated one of all.
And let us all note that as he disassembles all our clean air, clean water, and environmental standards, he is single-handedly sending our country and the planet to hell in a hand basket.

Farrow,,,False,EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369-0001,,,2017-10-15T04:00Z,2017-10-15T04:00Z,,,,,,,,Public Comment,,,,,,1.0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I am absolutely opposed to, and appalled at, the EPA's proposal to withdraw its July 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination that would, if finalized, have imposed restrictions on the discharge of dredged or fill material associated with the potential ""Pebble Mine"" in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed.  

I and my family have traveled to many of the national parks, especially in the southwest, and have a deep appreciation of the value of preserving our country's wild, natural habitats.  

The proposal to allow ""Pebble Mine,"" a subsidiary of a non-American/Canadian conglomerate, to build an open pit mine in one of our country's most pristine, natural habitats, should be rejected for many reasons, the least of which is that it would destroy forever the whole ecosystem in the area.  Bad laws, bad policies can eventually be reworked, but a natural ecosystem, once destroyed, is gone forever..

The ecosystem at issue is the habitat for many fish species, especially salmon, that thrive in the crystal clear waters of Bristol Bay.  Many carnivores also thrive in this pristine area.  Indigenous Indian tribes have lived in the area for thousands of years, and participate in a $480-million economy based on the natural resources found in Bristol Bay.  The aquatic, carnivores, and native peoples are all interdependent on each other, and have generated a successful way of life that benefits all.

The proposed Pebble Mine open pit mine would destroy all this.  I and my family have been to the King mine in southern AZ and it is really amazing to behold. But it demonstrates how degraded the land becomes as the mine destroys everything in its footprint, as well as adjacent lands into which the mining debris is dumped.  In Bristol Bay, the debris would be dumped into ""certain waters of the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creed watersheds in SW Alaska as disposal sites  for dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit, a copper-, gold-, and molybdenum-bearing ore body."" 

This is totally unacceptable!  Destroying this ecosystem can only have a negative impact on adjoining areas.  

The fact that this proposal is being entertained at all by the EPA is at odds with the best interest of our country.  Why would the EPA be willing to allow a commercial company destroy the Bristol Bay ecosystem?  It does not benefit our national or economic interests.

I fervently hope these comments are taken into consideration, and I fervently hope that there are enough legal and economic entities willing to fight to preserve the Bristol Bay ecosystem and deny Pebble Mine the rights to go forward with mining.

Withdrawing the Proposed Determination will put these benefits, as well as the preservation of a natural area of unique and pristine beauty, at risk in order to aid a foreign mining conglomerate. Withdrawal would serve oil, chemical and mining interests rather than the interest of the local population and would constitute an affront to the citizens of the United States through irreversible degradation of a unique environment. In effect, wild salmon - which need only clean water and healthy oceans - would be sacrificed for precious metals. And the sacrifice would be permanent.

Voting on the issue in 2014, Alaskans went overwhelmingly on record in support of protecting Bristol Bay and its environs from the billions of tons of toxic waste that would be produced by industrial-level mining operations.

I have personally witnessed long-term environmental degradation caused by operations such as the Copper Queen Mine in southern Arizona. While some might make the case that such effects in areas of open Southwestern desert are an acceptable tradeoff against the benefits accruing to private industry, I believe that no case can be supported that extends them to a unique and irreplaceable area of pristine beauty and finite natural bounty.

I strongly support the EPA's earlier conclusion that major mining operations in the area covered by the proposed withdrawal would have a ""catastrophic"" impact on the bay and just as strongly oppose the proposal to withdraw the July 2014 Proposed Determination.

Thank you.

The value of ores that could be extracted from this area per year is a mere fraction of the value found in fisheries. In addition, fisheries replenish every year while minerals do not. The benefit of a mine is low-value and short-term when compared to the salmon fisheries. Opening the area to mining activities would diminish water quality and would permanently (or at least for many, many generations) maim the salmon fisheries in Bristol Bay (an area that is home to half of the world's sockeye salmon, one of the most economically important salmon species). This would result in a great deal of food insecurity, lack of income, and job loss for the fisherman of Bristol Bay and cripple the region's economy. We have work to do to make the fisheries as sustainable as possible but the fisheries, even as is, are vastly more economically and culturally valuable than any mineral output that could be generated by mineral extraction.

As my Congressional representatives noted in their letter to the Trump Administration: ""A three-year Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study in 2014 found that the proposed mine would, even in the course of normal, safe mine operations, destroy 24 to 94 miles of salmon-producing waterways and pristine environment.""

The original regulation was developed over years, with extensive input from stakeholders and scientists.  The suggested overturn of the regulation ignored that thorough process, and was made after Scott Pruitt met with the CEO of Pebble Limited.  This is an egregious violation of the mission of the EPA.

The Pebble Mine project proposal must be withdrawn, and expressly and permanently destroyed, to protect the sanctity of Southwest Alaska.

I work as a fly fishing guide in Southwest Alaska precisely in the impact zone of the proposed mine and subsequent tailings. Rainbow King Lodge, in Iliamna AK, is where I spend my summers working to provide a remote wilderness experience to guests from around the world. We, as well as the native populations of these villages, thrive on these fisheries. I speak for those who are employed by the countless guiding outfits and lodges in this region of Alaska when I say that the Pebble Mine would devastate our way of life and ability to make a living. Most of my income is provided by the summer season when the largest wild salmon run in the world enters Lake Iliamna via Bristol Bay, followed by folks from around the world that come to be a part of, and experience such a beautiful and rare natural phenomenon. The risk of poisoning the watersheds mentioned in the proposal (Upper Talarik is, for example, one that we fish very often), due to accidental leeching or outright spilling of mine tailings and/or industrial waste, is simply too high.

This region of Southeast Alaska is one of those rare gems of our planet where wild things of all kind still exist, do not corrupt it with a profiteering venture for a foreign company. Around the world salmon runs have dwindled or been stamped out by human industry. In Russia. In Japan. In the Pacific Northwest. Once these runs are gone, they will not return. They are destroyed forever. Do not be the ones to tempt fate or gamble with such a poetic, unique, and irreplaceable resource. Do not allow this to be your legacy. Do not allow the Pebble partnership to establish this mine.

Watching the slow destruction of natural wildlife, habitat and the environment in the name of corporate profit is devastating. I do not consider myself an extreme environmental activist, but the current climate in the EPA and the policy choices that have been made in the Trump era EPA have me extremely frightened and, frankly, depressed. 

As human beings, we have been gift and the curse of our own abilities.  We are now using those abilities irresponsibly, allowing industry to trump nature.  This most recent development with lifting Bristol Bay protections to build a mine is irresponsible, its wrong, and humans and animals will pay for this poor judgement with their lives and quality of life.  It will be one domino in a long line of bad decisions, putting development and money over what is just. 

It is not up to us to play god and decide what animals should keep their lives and their habitat, and what animal's lives are worth less than gold and copper.  We only have one planet, we are destroying it by systematically removing animal's abilities to live and thrive. We do not need more copper, we do not need more gold, we need to keep this planet alive and thriving for the future of human kind.  With great power comes great responsibility. 

Please use your power to put the Bristol Bay protections back in place, and leave Bristol Bay to the Salmon and the Native people of Alaska who depend on the salmon of this region for life. 

Sincerely,

I am writing to implore the EPA to maintain its protections of the Pebble Deposit Area in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed.  It is widely recognized that that area is home to the world's largest salmon fishery.  Removing the protections that are in place for that particular area threatens to destroy large portions, if not all, of that fishery.  This would have significant financial, societal and environmental costs to America and its citizens.  

Financially, the fishery supports thousands of jobs linked to salmon fishing.  Those jobs would be lost by removing the existing protections in the area.  A three-year study conducted by the EPA concluded in 2014 that the allowance of mining activities by companies like Northern Dynasty Minerals (a Canadian, not American, company) would result in a complete loss of salmon habitat in significant portions of the watershed.  What's more, the jobs created by Northern Dynasty Minerals' mining operations would be fewer than the fishing jobs that would be lost as a result of salmon habitat destruction by Northern Dynasty.  The net effect would be to reduce available jobs rather than to increase them.

From a societal standpoint, the watershed produces nearly half of the world's annual sockeye salmon catch.  Salmon is a prominent part of the American and world diet, with Americans consuming it raw in sushi/sashimi, smoked, and grilled, broiled, and baked.  A growing segment of the world's population has come to appreciate wild, rather than farm-raised, salmon.  Destruction of this fishery will significantly curtail the availability of wild salmon in grocery stores and restaurants. Most Americans, along with those who purchase our salmon will feel this loss.

From an environmental perspective it should be recognized that fisheries, like the one located at Bristol Bay, take many centuries to develop.  They cannot be easily replaced or repaired.  

Destroying our fisheries, poisoning a pristine environment, eliminating jobs, and reducing a significant portion of the world's salmon population does not Make America Great Again.  It, instead, undermines America.

Please maintain the existing protections of the Pebble Deposit Area and its salmon fishery.  

Thank you,

In destroying spawning habitat, disposal of mine waste at the proposed sites would affect far more than the fish population in just that stretch of water through increasing risk to the population and species as a whole. I encourage review of the ""portfolio effect"" documented in salmon species (Schindler et al. 2010), which finds that species and populations are more stable and sustainable with greater life history diversity (i.e. with many subpopulations that return to different tributaries). This ensures that environmental variation in one year that affects a certain area of habitat, but not others, does not wipe out an entire population or species.

Furthermore, use of the proposed sites for mine waste disposal would have rippling effects throughout the ecosystem. I study brown bears who forage on sockeye salmon in tributaries of Iliamna Lake. Use these sites as disposal sites would prove detrimental to bears on a number of levels. First, bears are averse to human activity, and alter foraging patterns to avoid encountering humans (Ordiz et al. 2016, Martin et al. 2010). The large scale operations associated with Pebble Mine and the process of disposing mine waste are significant enough disturbances that bears may avoid foraging at nearby salmon streams entirely. If these are primary foraging grounds for some bears, this may impact bear growth and reproductive success, in turn potentially leading to reductions in bear populations, as growth and reproduction in bears are linked to salmon consumption (Hilderbrand et al. 1999a). Additionally, bears serve a critical role as transporters of marine-derived nutrients (Hilderbrand et al. 1999b) as they move salmon carcasses onto land where they can be used by a suite of secondary scavengers or decompose into components taken up by vegetation. If bears avoid salmon streams within a certain radius of mining activity, salmon-derived nutrients will not be integrated into these other pieces of the ecosystem, which may otherwise contribute to increased plant growth, which in turn improves stream habitat for juvenile salmonids (Helfield and Naiman, 2001).

I would also like to bring to the EPA's attention that withdrawing the proposed determination goes against several pieces of the EPA mission statement. First, this does not protect Americans from risks to human and environmental health, as it would allow exposure to mine waste contaminants when containment efforts inevitably fail. Second, it does not reduce environmental risks, as contaminants from spills will incorporate into organisms throughout the environment. Third this decision would not make ecosystems more sustainable and economically productive, as it may reduce salmon populations and hurt the large economy associated with the Bristol Bay salmon fishery. By retaining the proposed determination, the U.S. and EPA would prove to be a global leader in environmental protection, as we should strive to be.

- The EPA has previously determined that the planned pebble mine would cause great damage to the unparalleled salmon runs and local fisheries as well as to local Native communities. 

- The foreign owned pebble mine would cause significant damage to the world-renowned salmon runs of Bristol Bay. This fishery is worth moth than 1.5 million dollars a year and supports 14,000 jobs. All of this would be put at risk for the interests of a non-American mining company.

Please do not withdraw Clean Water Act restrictions for mining in the Bristol Bay watershed!
 
The upper Bristol Bay watershed is rare and precious because remains virtually pristine. Its many waterways support subsistence hunters, fishing tourism, and a diverse array of wildlife. Along with grizzly bears and bald eagles, the area boasts the world's most productive salmon run, where an incredible 30 million to 50 million fish return every summer to spawn. With its $1.5 billion sustainable commercial fishery, Bristol Bay supplies half of all sockeye salmon on the global market.  
 
The Pebble Mine would end all of this for all time because the chemicals used to separate the gold and copper deposits from the rest of the rock would create an unimaginable amount of toxic waste. It's no secret that dams leak, especially in wet and earthquake-prone regions like Bristol Bay. According to conclusions the EPA previously published, the mine would have the potential to destroy 94 miles of streams and 5,350 acres of wetlands, ponds, and lakes. It would also remove an extra 35 billion gallons of water from salmon habitat every year.
 
And that's only the mine itself. The necessary infrastructureroads, a major power plant, and a new deep-water port (adjacent to Cook Inlet, where belugas are currently fighting for survival) would also take their toll, bringing noise, water, and air pollution to the extended region and laying a solid foundation for other mining companies to move right in. It's undeniable: Pebble Mine would destroy Bristol Bay's wild salmon fishery and devastate the livelihoods of the people and communities that depend on it.

This is a environmental justice and human rights issue!
 
Please protect the Bristol Bay watershed.  Say no to mining there.

The 2014 determination was based on sound science, analysis and process and should not be withdrawn. 
I live and work in Region 10.  My livelihood relies on salmon.  I work towards salmon recovery and sustainable fishing opportunities in Region 10.

It is appallingly misguided and short-sighted.  All of Alaska and much of the world relies upon our wild salmon.  It is the subsistence lifeline of many people, most especially of the Alaska Natives in the Bristol Bay area. Our state has worked hard to protect this important natural resource.  Yet Alaska Natives have worked much harder and longer--protecting and harvesting it responsibly for the past 4,000 years!  I have lived in Anchorage, Alaska for 36 years and I, too, depend upon salmon as a weekly food source.  If such Clean Water protections are lifted, it is sadly easy for me to predict the outcome because of these reasons: I remember the U.S. waterways (and skies) before EPA regulations; I am a teacher committed to researching multiple trustworthy sources and viewpoints on critical issues, such as this one; and I was raised in two scientific communities due to my father's occupation as a nuclear physicist.  Therefore, I know that it is not a matter of IF there will be an environmental disaster as a result of withdrawing these protections, which are the next salvo in getting the Pebble Mine approved, but WHEN.  Such an impact would be catastrophic, irreversible, unconscionable, and tragic, especially given how preventable.  There is no logical or ethical justification for easing safeguards to allow businesses to prosper in the short-term while leaving the communities they (ab)use to shoulder the long-term effects.

To Whom it May Concern,

I  write in favor of the EPA's Withdrawal of the Proposed Determination against the Pebble Mine Project.

First of all, the legal and recognized way for vetting such a project is well established and has been used by all responsible government agencies and mining companies for years: the legally mandated NEPA permitting process.  Pebble Limited partnership (PLP) had not even completed the filing of an EIA, yet the EPA via its proposed Determination violated the law, and not for the first time, by manipulating, making up, and claiming that the PLP would carry out construction of a mine that was quite different from what PLP was planning to propose. It is time for the EPA to follow the law and procedures established under NEPA.

Given the illegal and bad faith behavior of the EPA in this procedural farce to date, PLP in all fairness should be allowed a guarantee that their project go forward.   I believe a fair court would be outraged by the EPA's behavior and grant a permit simply for recompense for the immense cost to Pebble in reputation and effort.  But the company is asking no guarantee.  Magnanimously, PLP is asking only that their project be treated as fairly as other projects are entitled to be treated; the right to go through the NEPA process and prove via that process that that their project deserves to be approved on the merits, and that they can (and will) prove they can mitigate any impacts their project could have on the local ecosystem.

Secondly, during the permitting process no harm will come to the environment.  In good faith, PLP has followed the law and the thicket of regulations of the State of Alaska, on whose land the project will sit, the EPA, and local regulations.  It is time for the EPA to also act in a legal, good faith manner, and allow the Army Corps of Engineers to lead this evaluation, as NEPA requires.

Third, the Pebble Project has become a ""cause celebre"" of fact-free and fantasy-filled environmental activists' claims.  No doubt the EPA will receive many form letters from those wishing to preemptively stop the Pebble project.  But it is time to do the right thing, follow the law, and give the PLP the due process it deserves, by withdrawing the proposed determination.

Sincerely,

Travis Anderson

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

My values have typically crossed party lines although I admit to not understanding what, if any, values are represented by
 the party that now controls every branch of the federal government.

Bristol Bay is an outstanding habitat for sockeye salmon. Like many such resources, it has recreational and economic values 
resulting from its value as a fish habitat. For example, see the link below.

https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/why-is-bristol-bay-important-for-salmon-and-seven-other-bristol-bay-facts 

Using this important and beautiful area as a disposal site is the antithesis of the central mission of the EPA. There is no
pressing need for this use of Bristol Bay. The history of the mining industry should make anyone extremely skeptical about
any means of retaining toxic mining tailings. This proposal withdraws restrictions on this sort of dumping. The earth belongs 
everyone, not just those with mineral rights. Mineral rights are not without restriction; just because Pebble Limited Partnership
may have mineral rights doesn't mean that they can turn Bristol Bay into another Superfund site. This planet is the only one 
we have, unless you consider cold, dry, airless, 36-million-mile-distant Mars to be a viable alternative.

There is no pressing reason to mine this site, especially with reduced or eliminated restrictions on ""disposal"". There are
pressing reasons not to. 

The EPA was created under Richard Nixon and has been a valiant steward of the environment until January, 2017. 
This is not about reversing Obama legacy; the EPA has had bipartisan support for decades, and for good reason. Turning
the EPA into a rubber stamp for looney projects is immoral. At some point, the electorate will revolt; that point could easily 
be 2018. If you can't do what is right, do what makes sense.

The EPA must not withdraw its protections for the largest sustainable salmon run on Earth (56 million annually), thousands of American fishing jobs, clean water (a human right), and rights of the indigenous people who have honored & lived on the salmon runs for thousands of years.
The EPA has already conducted an extensive review about the disastrous nature of this project: ""a larger-scale mine would result in the ""complete loss"" of salmon habitat in some areas of the watershed."" Furthermore, experts like University of Washington Fisheries Professor Ray Hillborn have stated ""The idea you could store highly toxic waste (from a mine) forever behind a dam is just ridiculous"" as he notes that the very reason the area is so productive for salmon (gravel beds) means it's very difficult to keep out mining toxins.
I do not see why Tom Collier (foreign Pebble CEO)'s secret meeting with Mr. Pruitt gives him the right to exploit one of the United States' greatest renewable resources. Why should a renewable, sustainable resource that belongs to Americans be exploited for foreign profit, so Pebble can construct the ""largest open pit mine ever constructed in North America... cover an area the size of Manhattan... a pit as 80% as deep as Grand Canyon.""
Please do not withdraw the protections for Bristol Bay! As a Washingtonian, I purchase wild-caught Alaska salmon all the time. It is a beautiful, amazing resource and I love visiting beautiful, unique Alaska.

Bristol Bay is a stronghold of diversity for both fish species and fisherman on the west coast of the US. The fishery supports not only Alaskan fisherman, but boats that transit up form other states. The impact of damaging the Bristol Bay watershed and ecosystem would not only hurt the salmonid and other fish species that live there, but the livelihoods of fisherman and related industries across multiple states. The number of jobs created by a mine would likely be far fewer than the fisheries (and related industries) in Bristol Bay currently support. Additionally, the profits from a mine would be concentrated in the hands of fewer people rather than spread over many as a public resource, thus furthering the equality gap which has been growing in the US. It does not make sense to alter the Bristol Bay watershed and ecosystem, in terms of jobs or in terms of ecology. Given that salmon runs in so many areas are imperiled for gone completely, it would be wise to maintain locations where these fish still thrive.

Instead, please finalize the protections for the last great wild-sockeye salmon fishery on the planet.

Bristol Bay, Alaska is the last remaining place on earth that produces naturally occurring salmon runs with annual returns in the  tens of millions of wild salmon.  The importance of an ecosystem that can support and naturally produce a salmon run of that size cannot be understated.  History and science both have taught us repeatedly that even small changes to these types of ecosystems can have catastrophic results.  The temporary gains from mining in the Bristol Bay watershed could never outweigh the potential long term losses that could result from the loss of a salmon run that has existed for thousands of years.  Myself, and nearly all other residents of Bristol Bay, depend heavily on the salmon for food and subsistence.  Beyond that the commercial and sport fisheries in the are by by far the largest employers and sources of income in the area.  Any damage, no matter how small or large, to one of the last remaining intact ecosystems in America would be an irreversible tragedy.  The salmon of Bristol Bay are just one piece of an intricately connected natural system.  The fish feed the people of the area through sport and subsistence fishing and the people of the world through the commercial fishery.  But the fish also feed the environment by transporting and depositing essential nutrients from the ocean upriver when they return there to spawn and die.  Bears and other animals rely on the salmon for food as well so they would also suffer from a loss of the salmon.

The money generated from a mine could never equal the value of one of the last great wild areas in the country, and the world.           Please do not withdraw or rescind the Proposed Determination for Docket EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369. Instead, please finalize the protections for the last great wild-sockeye salmon fishery on the planet.

The mine would impact an incredibly important fishing ground in Bristol Bay. Many residents and non residents depend on the economic structure regarding the salmon fishery in the area. Opening the Pebble mine would have a detrimental affect to these families, and to the salmon industry. 

Many other fish species could be affected as well. The area where the Pebble Mine would be located is an incredibly important area for nesting seabirds. These seabird colonies are already struggling from mass mortality events related to lack of food resources. A mass mortality event involves at least hundreds of confirmed dead animals washing ashore, but most recent events have been in the thousands. I have spent the past 9 years working at the Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward, AK, assisting researchers who are monitoring the mortality events around Resurrection Bay. Climate change is having an enormous impact on the bottom of our ocean's food chain, and we are watching a trophic cascade as the lack of food begins impacting animals up the food chain. We have seen mass mortalities of common murres, tufted puffins, northern fulmars, and fork-tailed storm petrels in just the past three years from Resurrection Bay through the Aleutians and as far north as the Pribilof Islands. These die-offs are followed by extremely poor breeding seasons. In 2016, there was 0% breeding success in all monitored common murre colonies. This is the case in many colonies across the state as well. We should not provide even more environmental stress in such an important ecosystem as Bristol Bay.  

The Pebble Mine would impact an incredibly important food supply area for many of the animals that come to Alaska for the bounty of food our oceans create in the summer. While Alaska is home to over 60% of the north pacific's breeding seabirds, this also includes whales and sharks that migrate north to feed. The impacts of the Pebble mine would be drastic and would be felt on every level. 

This is not a project that should happen in an already struggling ecosystem. I do not support this, and I will not support any pubic official who backs the Pebble mine. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Those risks include loss of up to up to 94 miles of salmon-supporting streams and up to 4,900 acres of wetlands and ponds, and the very real potential of wastewater dam failure resulting in damage to or destruction of the salmon fishery. The watershed supports the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world and 25 federally recognized tribes who for 4,000 years have depended on the fishery for their subsistence-based culture. The overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the project, and a statewide majority of voters also oppose it. The watersheds unique ecological resources generate significant economic benefits and employment. EPAs original watershed assessment was scientifically robust and thoroughly peer-reviewed. That assessment and related public comments should strongly influence any future action.

I have read about it, watched videos about, heard stories from friends about it, and all too often seen pictures of the amazing fish that grace its tributary streams.  I hope to one day be fortunate enough to visit and fish these hallowed waters.  As fly fisherman, environmental attorney, former guide, and Montana native, I have witnessed first hand both the power of a pristine fishery and the destructive force of mining activities on those resources.  In Montana, we have a history of mining.  My family were miners many generations ago.  But today I live with the deadly consequences that have lasted for more than 100 years from that history.  Today, tax payers from around the country pick up the tab for cleaning up the Clark Fork River, silver bow creek, Mike Horse Creek, and many others.  The Bull trout and cutthroat fisheries which once thrived in these streams are just a distant memory that modern day citizens can only dream about.  

Are we really willing to risk the greatest salmon fishery on the planet for a private company to make money?  How does that benefit the public?  How long will we remain attached to the vestiges of the Old West, where land grabs and gold rushes were thought to serve a public purpose?  We know better today.  There is no mine that is 100% safe.  Who will bear the burden of the loss if it occurs?  Will it be Pebble Partnership, or will it be the people of the United States and the world?  

Please don't make the same mistake we have made for generations.  This is an opportunity to say, ""not now and not here.""  Somethings are more valuable than gold.  No Pebble mine!",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I value that this fishery generates over 20 thousand American jobs from Alaska to Maine in salmon fishing and related industries, such as shipbuilding. I value that the fishery provides over half the word's sockeye salmon and that Native Alaskans have relied on this fishery for subsistence and livelihood for centuries.

I respect the rigorous science behind the EPA's findings that even a small mine would pose unacceptable risks to the fishery.  I respect the model process by which the EPA involved all stakeholders in deliberaions leading up to the proposed July 2014 Determination  under the Clean Water Act. I am grateful for the support various members of Congress from Washington gave early on and continue to give for protections from open pit mining in Bristol Bay.

I feel duty bound to comment here on Pebble Limited Partnership's (PLP)  lawsuits against the EPA, I note the following: U.S. District Court Judge H. R. Holland dismissed PLP's challenge to the EPA's authority to perform a Bristol Bay Watershed Assessment; the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld this decision. Judge Holland also ruled that PLP does not have a valid legal basis for stopping EPA's deliberations about whether it should block large scale mining.  Regarding the remaining litigation, concerning whether the EPA acted improperly under the Federal Advisory Committee -   by his unilateral decision to work behind the scenes with PLP and stop the litigation process, Administrator Pruitt excused PLP from having to provide proof for its allegations; there is high likelihood that the allegations were not supported by facts.  Mr. Pruitt's actions robbed the EPA of a fair hearing and the public of the right to see evidence.  I see no justification for Mr. Pruitt's actions here, actions connected with the proposal to withdraw the July 2014 Determination.

I oppose withdrawing the EPA's July 2014 Determination ""for the reasons stated.""  Withdrawing the July 20d14 Determination would create more regulatory uncertainty, not less, as claimed.  No justification for giving priority to PLP's possible ""perceived"" uncertainty is given nor is any justification apparent.  No explanation for why the withdrawal is ""appropriate"" is given. 

The proposal to withdraw the July 2014 Determination was made arbitrarily without due process after a private meeting with Tom Collier, CEO of PLP and without consulting with EPA staff.

Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act authorizes he EPA to prohibit, deny or restrict discharge of dredged material at defined sites if unacceptable adverse impacts on fisheries, wildlife, recreational areas exist.  Existing law and evidence-based science should be guiding the EPA's decisions, which is not the case currently.

Thank you for this opportunity to comment.

Congratulations on your new job as Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. I'm writing to let you know that I, and the majority of Alaskans, expect that you will continue the excellent science-based work that the EPA has done in Bristol Bay, Alaska. I understand from the news that you are opposed to regulations that hurt jobs. Bristol Bay already supports 14,000 American jobs in the fishing industry and those jobs will be hurt by any favorable regulations you put in place for the Pebble mine - owned by a foreign company.

Bristol Bay, Alaska is home to the world's largest runs of sockeye salmon and those fish are an economic engine that contribute $1.5 billion to the United States economy. These salmon have sustained Alaska Native cultures for generations, and today fuel the dreams of hunters and anglers around the world who come to hunt and fish in Bristol Bay. This is the reason that an unprecedented bi-partisan coalition in Alaska is fighting against the Pebble project. 

This is also the reason that Alaskans overwhelmingly supported a state-wide anti-Pebble initiative two years ago. Nearly all of the local elected officials and tribal leaders oppose the mine - despite what Pebble has told you on the record. 

We are grateful that EPA has listened to Alaskans about the Pebble Mine. We hope that you will continue to listen to those who have the most to lose if Pebble gets built. Salmon are, and will continue to be, the cornerstone of our history, culture, and economy in Alaska. It is imperative that we protect American jobs from this foreign mining company.",,,,,,https://downloads.regulations.gov/EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369-7986/attachment_1.xlsx,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I am opposed to EPA's proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to save Bristol Bay's world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.
As you know, Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually. This supports upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serves as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and is the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.
These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine. Although Alaskans typically support resource development, more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents oppose the proposed Pebble Mine. 
Over the course of the EPA's own comment and public review processes, the EPA received more than 1.5 million comments asking for strong protections for Bristol Bay. Withdrawing the proposed determination would fly in the face of an overwhelming majority of Alaskans and put the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of American jobs. 
Today I ask that you stand with American jobs and communities and not withdraw the proposed determination. Please do not trade American businesses and jobs or our wild salmon for the shallow promises of a foreign mining company.

The 2014 ruling was made in good faith and should not be changed in order to fit the wishes of a corporate entity that stands to profit from the change. Far too many people, who are true stakeholders in Alaska's economy and general well-being, stand to lose if the proposed change is made. Few advantages will adhere to those same people (and indeed, to the public at large) if the mine is established. This is not a scientifically verifiable issue, it is an issue of political justice and US sovereignty.

Approval of the changes will place control of a significant set of Alaskan (US) resources beyond the effective control of Alaska and perhaps even the US government, to which past, present and no doubt future, superfund sites stand in testimony as proof of the unacceptable risk involved in such transactions. The issue is more pressing when the resources concerned are irreplaceable, in fact, invaluable. 

Apart from US experiences with corporate environmental crimes, observations from all over the world demonstrate the fact that corporate actions are taken with one aim, to maximize profit, very often, perhaps even usually, at the expense of environmental and political justice. How does a scientifically verifiable process address such injustice? Whether or not the EPA mandate includes such considerations, in actual fact, they are the crux of the problem concerning the Pebble Mine. Reconsideration of the EPA's original ruling is beyond defense.

It has been much more isolated from development than many parts of Alaska.  Shoals, sandbars and shallows, along with high winds and the eighth most extreme tides in the world make it difficult for large ships to navigate.  This isolation has allowed fish to maintain their health and abundance.  Bristol Bay is one of the outstanding salmon fisheries left in the world.  Every year salmon fishing, for both commerce and sport, brings about $310 million to Alaska. This flow of healthy food and Alaskan income can continue for the foreseeable future if we don't interfere with it. 

The world's human population is exploding.  This is putting pressure already on our ability to feed all people, particularly the ability to get everyone adequate, healthy protein.  The oil in salmon is well known to be good for the cardiovascular system.  

No one can say for sure how long salmon would last in Bristol Bay if the Pebble Mine goes forward.  Behind a huge dam would be an unlined lake containing 10 billion tons of such toxic chemicals as sulfuric acid, mercury, arsenic, lead, zinc, and cadmium.  Furthermore, there are many other corporately held mine leases in the region that are currently inactive.  If the Pebble Mine's large corporate owners invested in the infrastructure for their mine, it likely would make it possible for smaller companies to become active on their leases.

The salmon might end through relatively slow attrition, as water is diverted to mining operations and impurities flow through the soil into the water remaining in the rivers.  Or it might end suddenly with the collapse of one of the dams holding back the impounded toxic chemicals that are inevitably a by-product of mining.  Either way, a major source of food for the world and income for Alaska will be lost forever.

No one could say it better than Ted Williams in Audubon Magazine, Nov/Dec 2012:

""What possibly could unite these diverse and in some cases adversarial players in outrage and action: 700 businesses; 700 hunting and angling groups; 77 commercial fishing groups; 200 chefs and restaurant owners; the National Council of Churches, representing 45 million people; major newspapers; leading jewelry retailers; and ultra-conservative legislators?

It would be a plan to gouge and hack the Bristol Bay watershed of southwest Alaska with the continent's biggest strip mine.""

Please use your authority under the Clean Water Act to prohibit the proposed construction of the horribly destructive Pebble Mine.

Administrator E. Scott Pruitt

Dear Administrator Pruitt,

Subject: 	Docket ID No. EPA-R10-OW-2017-0369
Maintain protections for Bristol Bay Watershed

I am writing in opposition to the proposal to withdraw the EPA Region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination that was issued pursuant of the Clean Water Act, to restrict mining activity associated with the Pebble deposit, a copper-, gold-, and molybdenum-bearing ore body.

The Bristol Bay region of Alaska is one of the great ecologic resources of the world. It is the site of the largest remaining run of wild sockeye salmon, and it produces roughly 50% of the world's commercial supply of wild sockeye salmon. It is the home of Alaska Native people who continue the subsistence fishing and hunting traditions of their ancestors. It is an important economic driver for the commercial fishing, sport hunting and sport fishing industries of North America.

The Pebble gold and copper deposit is found in association with sulfides, which could generate acid mine drainage when extracted. Acid mine drainage is a potentially severe water pollution issue and the most significant liability associated with mining.

The ecological, economic, and social value of the Bristol Bay salmon fishery should be protected. Mining threatens that value - the risk is far too great and we cannot be confident that mining company steps to mitigate that risk will succeed.  

This is an economic argument. A report published by the Natural Capital Declaration, November 2015 called Towards Including Natural Resource Risks in Cost of Capital, State of play and the way forward, Natural Capital Declaration, 2015, addresses the economic value of natural ecosystems.  Quoting from that report:

""The value that nature provides to revenue-generating activities, depends on the stocks and flows and the quality of ecosystem goods and services available. This is ""natural capital"", and is being eroded rapidly and globally. Over-exploitation, pollution and environmental degradation are undermining the earth's capacity to deliver the natural resources and stable environmental operating conditions required to sustain economic activities and a growing world population.""  

http://www.unepfi.org/fileadmin/documents/NCD-NaturalResourceRisksScopingStudy.pdf

Allowing a mine to be built in an area that threatens one of the largest sources of sustainable salmon protein in the world does not make sense. The EPA 2014 proposed determination recognized this threat and the restriction of mining activity should be maintained. 

Sincerely,

If approved, the Pebble Mine would be the largest mine of its type in North America. The mine itself would cover up to 6.9 square miles, with an 18 square mile wastewater pond to store the 10 billion tons of potentially toxic waste the mine is expected to generate.  It isn't just the potential for an irreversible environmental catastrophe that is driving widespread opposition to the Pebble Mine. As of 2009, the Bristol Bay watershed generated hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity annually and 14,000 jobs, primarily in the fishing industry. All of that could be at risk if the disastrous Pebble Mine project is allowed to move forward.

Please move forward with a Final Determination on the proposed Pebble Mine under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act without delay.

To whom it may concern,

Southwest Alaska is valuable for it's natural beauty, multiple fish species, including the valuable salmon fisheries that so many Alaskans depend on for food source and revenue. 
Short sighted goals to withdraw restrictions from polluting these environments with harmful disposal sights for no ones' gain except for a minor few of closed minded individuals.

The Environmental Protection Agency must stand up for its sole purpose, Environmental Protection!

As an Alaskan resident in the Upper Susitna Valley for 13 years, I'd like to emphasize the importance of protecting rivers and the fragile ecosystem for immediate and future generations.

There has been so much extensive analysis, and from the executive summary it seems this is still considered to be a conservative analysis of adverse effects, done for this July 14 Proposed Determination, but the conclusion was still that the planned mining project would result in unacceptable adverse effects on the environment and beyond. It seems the Region 10 Administrator supports the findings in this proposed determination and I am very glad to see that.  I hope the ""EPA may use its scientific assessment regarding the Bristol Bay Watershed without limitation"" portion of the May 2017 settlement means that all this extensive analysis and information will be considered throughout the entire process that decides upon the future of the Bristol Bay watershed area .The proposed mine pit itself, which seems to be the largest pit known thus far, and its possible discharges seem to be a perfect setup for massive and irreversible environmental damage with potential long-term adverse effects for the region, its people and the world.  I cannot see why all this would be considered acceptable to appease the narrow-minded interests of the few.  Although I have many thoughts and feelings about this issue, I will try to express them through my favorite John Muir quotes of :

""Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul.""

""When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe""

""God never made an ugly landscape. All that the sun shines on is beautiful, so long as it is wild.""

I hope the soul-stirring truths above are taken into strong consideration by all those who are involved in deciding the fate of this pristine and amazing ecosystem and all of the lives intertwined with it.

Corporate America does NOT represent the health and safety of the American public and the environment of this planet.  The energy industry should be putting its vast resources into developing clean, sustainable energy, not energy that taints everything it comes into contact with.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

As a lover of wild places and wild life, development of this area directly affects me.  The headwaters of the world's greatest salmon fishery is an incredibly stupid place to build a open pit copper, gold and molybdenum mine that would trap 10 billion tons of toxic mining waste behind a several mile-long, 700 foot-high, earthen dam in a region known to experience earthquakes; a dam that would have to be maintained for thousands of years into the future.

The idea that Bristol Bay is the world's greatest salmon fishery isn't hyperbole. Almost half (46%) of the world's salmon harvest each year comes from Bristol Bay. It supports 14,000 jobs and is worth an estimated $1.5 billion annually. And it is the sustaining force behind 4,000 year old native Alaskan cultures that continue rely on Bristol Bay's natural plenty to survive.

In 2014, Canada's Mount Polley minewhich, though much smaller, is very similar to the type of mine that Pebble would come to beoffered the world a glimpse at what future could await Bristol Bay if Pebble were built and its tailing dam were to fail. When Polley's tailings dam burst, it released its toxic tailings slurry into Polley Lake, Hazeltine Creek, Quesnel Lake and Cariboo Creek. It has been characterized as one of the greatest environmental disasters in modern Canadian historyflooding nearby waters and wetlands with arsenic, selenium and other heavy metals. Prior to the disaster, Polley was one of the mines that the Pebble Limited Partnership (PLP) had held out as an example of mines and fisheries co-existing. PLP even hired the same engineering firm that Mount Polley hada firm that had rebutted the EPA's findings, stating that dams don't fail.

Both the science and the voice of the American public have made it entirely clear that Bristol Bay is the wrong place to build a open pit ore mine that would place a pristine ecosystem, the world's greatest salmon fishery, the jobs of 14,000 Americans and several thousand year-old native cultures in grave and serious peril.

What's at stake? 

The largest sustainable salmon fishery in the world, typically supplying almost half of the world's wild sockeye salmon (""The Economic Importance of the Bristol Bay Salmon Industry"" by the Institute of Social and Economic Research, University of Alaska - Anchorage). In 2010, harvesting, processing, and retailing Bristol Bay salmon and the multiplier effects of these activities created $1.5 billion in output or sales value across the United States. In 2010, Bristol Bay salmon fishermen harvested 29 million sockeye salmon worth $165 million in direct harvest value alone. That represented 31% of the total Alaska salmon harvest value, and was greater than the total value of fish harvests in 41 states. Salmon processing in Bristol Bay increased the value by $225 million, for a total first wholesale value after processing of $390 million. The total value of Bristol Bay salmon product exports in 2010 was about $250 million, or about 6% of the total value of all U.S. seafood exports. In 2010, the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishery supported 12,000 fishing and processing jobs during the summer salmon fishing season. Measuring these as year-round jobs, and adding jobs created in other industries, the Bristol Bay salmon fishery created the equivalent of almost 10,000 year-round American jobs across the country, and brought Americans $500 million in income. For every dollar of direct output value created in Bristol Bay fishing and processing, more than two additional dollars of output value are created in other industries, as payments from the Bristol Bay fishery ripple through the economy. These payments create almost three jobs for every direct job in Bristol Bay fishing and processing. As a significant associated benefit, a positive health trend in the United States is increased consumption of fish, supported by Bristol Bay frozen sockeye salmon.

Other critical values include ecosystems that depend upon this keystone group, subsistence fishers, Native American culture that relies upon salmon for existence and religious practices, the integrity of U.S. National Park lands (Katmai and Lake Clark), and the ecotourism industry.

Salmon are keystone species relied upon by many aquatic and terrestrial organisms, including forests dependent on nutrients brought from the ocean by migrating fish.  Bears, such as the Brown bears at Katmai, depend upon salmon for a large portion of their energy uptake.  The ecotourism industry depends upon a functioning and pristine ecosystem and the creatures that inhabit those places.

What's the problem?

We live in West Virginia, and formerly Kentucky, and we know what mining does to streams and fish.  Groundwater and surface waters are contaminated through leaching and outright spills from permanent tailings reservoirs, resulting in contaminated game fish and local extinctions of invertebrates and fishes.  Specifically, copper is a distinct toxin to fish, and can injure the salmon ability to ""smell"" and thereby impair return rates to natal streams.  Road development, slurry pipelines, and other infrastructure disrupt watersheds, terrestrial ecosystems, and add fine sediments to streams.  The impairment of Bristol Bay and surrounding lands will occur, there is no doubt.

What's the potential gain?

1000 direct jobs. Significant short-term profits for the owners.

What's the conclusion?

To put an entire ecosystem and its benefits at risk for short term gains in mineral wealth is irresponsible and inviting disaster.

Yet, history has proved otherwise. Habitat destruction is one of the major causes of population decline in species and biodiversity.  Of the five Pacific Salmon (Chinook, Coho, Pink, and Sockeye), all are either threatened or endangered.  It is imperative that Bistrol Bay Fishery in Alaska be preserved for future generations.  Bristol Bay is one of the world's most productive fisheries, mining would have a detrimental effect on this wetland, and our environment should be protected.

Bristrol Bay is one of the most valuable wild fisheries on Earth (CNN).  This important fishery produces nearly half of the world's sockeye salmon catch. In addition, this area's ecological resources support almost 4,000-year-old cultures as well as 14,000 full and part time jobs

The Clean Water Act was educed to safeguard Bristol Bay from loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources from mining (CNN).
This mine would result in irreversible elimination of the salmon and would be detrimental to surrounding aquatic resources.

In an era that is marked with more animal and plant extinction than during the dinosaurs' demise 65 million years ago, we need to think of our planet's health first. Therefore, the only responsible decision for EPA should be a denial to the proposal to withdraw proposed determination to restrict the use an area as a disposal site.

I understand that Scott Pruit, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, met with Tom Collier, Pebble Limited Partnership and shortly afterward started to withdraw a plan that protects the watershed of Bristol Bay. According to Liz Bowman on CNN, an EPA spokeswoman, ""The meeting was an opportunity for Administrator Pruit to let {Pebble Limited Partnership} know that they are simply being granted a fair opportunity to apply; he did not prejudge the outcome of the process, nor make any assurances about the final decision on the project.

However, I was concerned when Pruit met with a mining CEO and proceeded to go forward with this suspicious project.  Adversely, the Obama administration wanted to protect the fishery after finding out that a mine would result in complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of waterways.  All of these losses would be irreversible!  I can only wonder what political or monetary motivations are afoot.

There are always two sides to every story, but I believe that there is only one right answer to this dilemma.  The world would suffer from a loss of the valuable area.  Not only would the losses would be irreversible, but also the disappearance of this environment would cause an ecological ripple effect. Bristol Bay Fishery needs to be preserved.  Revoking this determination would be a drastic mistake.

I am writing in response to the public comment period regarding whether the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should withdraw the EPA Region 10 July 2014 Proposed Determination that was issued pursuant to Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act, to restrict the use of certain waters in the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds in southwest Alaska as disposal sites for dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit, a copper-, gold-, and molybdenum-bearing ore body. The answer is an emphatic NO, as I will describe below.

In response to a 2010 petition from Bristol Bay's tribes, Native corporations, commercial fishers, the sports and recreation industry, and many others, to protect Bristol Bay from the risks posed by the proposed Pebble mine, the EPA initiated an extensive review and study process. Those risks were to salmon, waterways, people, and the economy, and included the Native Alaskan people who live in Southwest Alaska and depend for their food, livelihood, culture, and way of life, on the salmon and associated ecosystems of Bristol Bay. The subsequent EPA Assessment was undertaken in cooperation with state and federal agencies, universities, and other experts with responsibility and knowledge of the fishery and associated resources in the area, the well-being of the area's residents, the sportfish, hunting, and other recreational values of the area, and the economic dependence of tens of thousands of other Americans on these resources.

As a wildlife biologist and supervisor of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Anchorage Fish and Wildlife Field Office until my retirement at the end of 2012, I am well aware of the depth and breadth of the studies that were completed and which were the justification for the EPA's appropriate 2014 determination and action. As Field Supervisor, I participated in numerous meetings and oversaw staff completion of a report on the terrestrial resources in the area and their dependence on marine derived nutrients - i.e., the salmon eaten as prey or carrion by bears, eagles, and other wildlife, and that become decaying nutrients taken up by plants or which enrich Bristol Bay waterways. (Appendix C of the EPA Watershed Assessment: Wildlife Resources of the Nushagak and Kvichak River Watersheds, Alaska, subsequently published as a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report: Brna, P. J. and L. A. Verbrugge (eds). 2013. Wildlife resources of the Nushagak and Kvichak River watersheds, Alaska. Final Report. Anchorage Fish and Wildlife Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Anchorage, AK. 177 pp. Available: http://alaska.fws.gov/fisheries/fieldoffice/anchorage/environmental.htm). 

The process undertaken by the EPA involved two draft reports, a scientific review panel, scientific and technical peer reviews, and many public meetings and comment periods. Over 300,000 comments were received by EPA, the huge majority of which supported the withdrawal of Bristol Bay watersheds from mining, due to the expected harm to the salmon and people, livelihoods, way of life, and state and federal economies supported by those watersheds. A quick review of even just the executive summary of your agency's 2014 Assessment provides ample scientific and technical information in support of EPA's determination then. There is no new information to show that a tailings dam will never fail, or that mining can be done in an environmentally sound manner in this area! Even permitting a very small mine means it is just a matter of time before the mining spreads and expands throughout the area. Look at what has happened with Prudhoe Bay - providing the infrastructure for one development ensures the development of adjacent areas.

Compromising Bristol Bay for a mine is unacceptable. EPA proposed scientifically backed protections for the Bristol Bay watershed. I implore you not to withdraw those proposed protections! Listen to the people - over 60 % of Alaskans, and over 80 % of Bristol Bay residents want to protect this area from mining.

Thank you for your attention to my concerns, and the concerns of hundreds of thousands of other Alaskans and Americans!

Sincerely, 
Ann G. Rappoport",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

As you know, Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Tens of millions of wild salmon return annually, which support upwards of 14,000 American jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, serve as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world, and are the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities.

These long-established American businesses and jobs are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2010, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region.

I am strongly opposed to your proposal to withdraw the protections established by Region 10 of the Environmental Protection Agency in their July 2014 Proposed Determination about Bristol Bay waters. That determination was made with regard to Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act, and would restrict the use of certain waters in the South Fork Koktuli River, North Fork Koktuli River, and Upper Talarik Creek watersheds in southwest Alaska as disposal sites for dredged or fill material associated with mining the Pebble deposit, a copper-, gold-, and molybdenum-bearing ore body.

It is unacceptable to compromise Bristol Bay for a mine! EPA recognized the threat of the mine to the area when proposing scientifically backed protections for the Bristol Bay watershed. Those protections were based on several years of scientific and technical studies, countless public hearings, peer-reviews, and hundreds of thousands of public comments, all clearly pointing to the need to protect the salmon in this area. By protecting the salmon, we allow thousands of Native Alaskans to continue to subsist on these resources and their associated ecosystem as they have for thousands of years, and we do not jeopardize a $1.5 billion seafood industry. We also protect the recreational hunting and fishing enjoyed by thousands of other Alaskans and Americans. 

The bottom line is that there is no new information leading to a different conclusion than the one in EPA's 2014 Determination. STOP now and DO NOT withdraw those proposed protections! Large-scale industrial mining does not belong here. 

If the EPA ignores the science and throws out the proposed protections, we risk losing the last greatest wild sockeye salmon fishery in Alaska and the country. This is not worth some deal with a foreign mining company. Our future is at stake. I am opposed to the Pebble mine.

EPA should not withdraw the July 2014 Proposed Determination at this timeor everbecause EPA's Section 404(c) preemptive veto was appropriate in the case of Pebble Mine. The Proposed Determination should remain in place, and the Bristol Bay watershed should be withdrawn from mineral development indefinitely.

The July 2014 Proposed Determination was the correct decision in this case because Pebble Mine is so clearly inappropriate for this setting and the American people. The E.P.A. should leave the July 2014 Proposed Determination in placenot withdraw itand should never allow the Pebble Mine to be applied for, permitted, or developed.

No mining should occur in this valuable watershed for legal, environmental, and cultural reasons.

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act gives clear discretionary authority to the EPA to use its expertise to determine whether the pollution of dredge or fill materials is permissible in light of potential environmental harms. The science is clear: The salmon, the rivers, the watershed, the entire ecosystem of this region are too precious and vulnerable to long-term harm if mining were to be permitted. The 2014 decision clearly stated the science to support this finding and should thus be upheld and defended by the EPA today. 

The importance of this watershed to the ecosystem cannot be overstated. Salmon runs are declining across the country, and maintaining a healthy environment for sockeye, chinook, and all Pacific salmon which utilize these waters is vital. Beyond the salmon are many other marine species that are essential to a healthy system that extends far beyond these waters and can have impacts throughout the world. 

And, just as importantly, Alaska depends on these waters to provide a healthy fishery to sustain jobs, traditional subsistence practices, and the culture of this region. Fishing is not just a job, it is a way of life. The importance of maintaining a healthy fishery is apolitical. Livelihoods, food security, traditional culture, recreation, and more, all rely on keeping these waters clean. 

As an Alaska resident, I ask that you listen to the voices of the people in this community who hope to have these healthy ecosystems for the next seven generations.

I'm lucky to have worked & lived on Bristol Bay, which fosters the most valuable and prolific salmon fishery in the world.   

The proposed Pebble Mine sits at the headwaters of specific rivers which boast the largest runs in the world. The acid drainage potential from the tailings could be terminal to the fishery by itself, not to mention the mine's network of roads, bridges, and culverts that would do significant harm to the upper reaches of the fishery. 85% of commercial fishermen and 80% of the local community around Bristol Bay oppose the Pebble Mine. 

The University of Alaska's own ISER found that the economic benefits of the fishery greatly outweigh the alleged economic benefit of the mine. Furthermore, the Pebble Limited Partnership itself estimates that the mine would only provide a maximum of 1,000 fulltime employees for the first 20 years (after which, that number will greatly decrease, just like the mineral reserves). The Bristol Bay salmon fishery provides 14,000 jobs a year, to people who harvest a renewable resource in a sustainable economic model that can go on in perpetuity if this fishery is protected. A copper and gold mine, however, cannot provide a sustainable economic model as it's based on a finite resource. That finite resource will be torn and blown from the headwaters of Bristol Bay watershed which is crucial to a sustainable economic resource, salmon. The harvest of salmon provides over 10 times as many jobs as the mine ever will in the (maybe) 15-20 years before it goes cold and most the mine staff is laid off.    

The Pebble Limited Partnership is entirely owned by Northern Dynasty Minerals, a foreign company. The largest institutional shareholder (by a significant margin) of Northern Dynasty Minerals is Vertex One, and also a foreign company. Any pro-mine argument claiming some kind of economic benefit is actually (if anything) an argument on behalf of foreign companies, who are the profiteers of this mine - no on behalf of Alaskan job opportunities. 

The destructive potential from and public disdain for this mining operation has been recognized by some of the world's largest mining and investment entities, as well. Mitsubishi, Anglo American, and Rio Tinto are just a few of the former partners that have chosen to abandon the Pebble Mine development due to the comprehensively-acknowledged harms it would create for the world famous fishery, and the entire salmon industry at large.   

This mine will not just hurt the fishery in its early years, but its toxicity will continue harm to the watershed long after the handful of people who benefit from the mine it are gone. 

The EPA's approval of this mine would, objectively, put the priorities of a foreign multinational corporation over Alaskans and Americans who participate in and depend on the salmon industry in Bristol Bay. It would also put the wallets of a few foreign corporate executives over the livelihoods of thousands of living and yet-to-be-born Americans. The EPA should leave the July 2014 Proposed Determination in place, and never approve the development of Pebble Mine (or give a foreign corporation a green-light to harm a sustainable resource many Americans depend on). 

Americans who are one year-old right now won't even be done with high school when (A) the mineral deposits are significantly depleted, and (B) the majority of the ""maybe 1,000 jobs"" Pebble Mine claims it can provide ""only for the first 20 years or so"" no longer exist. Alternatively, that same one year-old American's great grand children could provide for their families and enjoy the sustainable natural resource of Bristol Bay salmon (if we protect it). Pleasing the foreign beneficiaries of the Pebble Mine and protecting the future cultural and economic benefits to Americans that Bristol Bay can provide are indeed mutually exclusive in this circumstance.

After the production of a voluminous peer-reviewed scientific record of the harms this mine would cause, and a decade of bipartisan wholesale opposition to it - from environmentalists to tribal leaders to commercial fishermen to loggers - It's ridiculous this is still being considered, and its a pretty simple call here guys: 

EPA: Tell Northern Dynasty Minerals to go blow up mountains and pollute rivers somewhere that won't harm the healthiest and most valuable salmon run on earth, because Alaskans and concerned Americans in the lower 48 (and, indisputably, the VAST majority of stakeholders) don't want economic and ecological harm to our sustainable resources for the benefit of a few (already incredibly wealthy) foreign mining moguls.

I can't fathom why the EPA is now proposing to rescind a determination based on its own (3-year, peer-reviewed) study, except for the fact that the guy now running the agency is owned by corporate interests.

I'm lucky to have worked & lived on Bristol Bay, which fosters the most valuable and prolific salmon fishery in the world. 

The proposed Pebble Mine sits at the headwaters of specific rivers which boast the largest runs in the world. The acid drainage potential from the tailings could be terminal to the fishery by itself, not to mention the mine's network of roads, bridges, and culverts that would do significant harm to the upper reaches of the fishery. 85% of commercial fishermen and 80% of the local community around Bristol Bay oppose the Pebble Mine. 

The University of Alaska's own ISER found that the economic benefits of the fishery greatly outweigh the alleged economic benefit of the mine. Furthermore, the Pebble Limited Partnership itself estimates that the mine would only provide a maximum of 1,000 fulltime employees for the first 20 years (after which, that number will greatly decrease, just like the mineral reserves). The Bristol Bay salmon fishery provides 14,000 jobs a year, to people who harvest a renewable resource in a sustainable economic model that can go on in perpetuity if this fishery is protected. A copper and gold mine, however, cannot provide a sustainable economic model as it's based on a finite resource. That finite resource will be torn and blown from the headwaters of Bristol Bay watershed which is crucial to a sustainable economic resource, salmon. The harvest of salmon provides over 10 times as many jobs as the mine ever will in the (maybe) 15-20 years before it goes cold and most the mine staff is laid off. 

The Pebble Limited Partnership is entirely owned by Northern Dynasty Minerals, a foreign company. The largest institutional shareholder (by a significant margin) of Northern Dynasty Minerals is Vertex One, and also a foreign company. Any pro-mine argument claiming some kind of economic benefit is actually (if anything) an argument on behalf of foreign companies, who are the profiteers of this mine - no on behalf of Alaskan job opportunities. 

The destructive potential from and public disdain for this mining operation has been recognized by some of the world's largest mining and investment entities, as well. Mitsubishi, Anglo American, and Rio Tinto are just a few of the former partners that have chosen to abandon the Pebble Mine development due to the comprehensively-acknowledged harms it would create for the world famous fishery, and the entire salmon industry at large. 

This mine will not just hurt the fishery in its early years, but its toxicity will continue harm to the watershed long after the handful of people who benefit from the mine it are gone. 

The EPA's approval of this mine would, objectively, put the priorities of a foreign multinational corporation over Alaskans and Americans who participate in and depend on the salmon industry in Bristol Bay. It would also put the wallets of a few foreign corporate executives over the livelihoods of thousands of living and yet-to-be-born Americans. The EPA should leave the July 2014 Proposed Determination in place, and never approve the development of Pebble Mine (or give a foreign corporation a green-light to harm a sustainable resource many Americans depend on). 

Americans who are one year-old right now won't even be done with high school when (A) the mineral deposits are significantly depleted, and (B) the majority of the ""maybe 1,000 jobs"" Pebble Mine claims it can provide ""only for the first 20 years or so"" no longer exist. Alternatively, that same one year-old American's great grand children could provide for their families and enjoy the sustainable natural resource of Bristol Bay salmon (if we protect it). Pleasing the foreign beneficiaries of the Pebble Mine and protecting the future cultural and economic benefits to Americans that Bristol Bay can provide are indeed mutually exclusive in this circumstance.

After the production of a voluminous peer-reviewed scientific record of the harms this mine would cause, and a decade of bipartisan wholesale opposition to it - from environmentalists to tribal leaders to commercial fishermen to loggers - It's ridiculous this is still being considered, and its a pretty simple call here guys: 

EPA: Tell Northern Dynasty Minerals to go blow up mountains and pollute rivers somewhere that won't harm the healthiest and most valuable salmon run on earth, because Alaskans and concerned Americans in the lower 48 (and, indisputably, the VAST majority of stakeholders) don't want economic and ecological harm to our sustainable resources for the benefit of a few (already incredibly wealthy) foreign mining moguls.

I have spent 24 years of my life in the salmon industry in Alaska and the last six years making a film about the sacredness of salmon called The Breach.  Bristol Bay is a place of profound beauty, economic value and spiritual significance to the people who've lived there for thousands of years.  Salmon is the centerpiece of their life, spiritual practice and livelihoods.  

Bristol Bay's significance is hard to articulate unless you've been there.  This summer of 2017, I was able to spend several weeks fishing out of Egegik and saw firsthand the vast biological treasure that sockeye salmon are to the region.  Over 56 million fish returned this year - the 4th largest return in history.  It's impossible not to be moved in a profound way when encountering a natural wonder of this magnitude.

Whether to allow a large, open-pit, low-grade sulphur mine at the headwaters of a salmon run like this should not be taken lightly.  And your agency clearly did not when they spent three years and millions of taxpayer dollars conducting an intensive, scientific watershed assessment of the region and what would likely happen if a mine like Pebble was built in Bristol Bay.  

As a common-sense idea, it doesn't take much to reach the conclusion that a mine like Pebble would irreparably cause significant change at least and catastrophic disaster at worst to the people, water and wild salmon of Bristol Bay.  As a 3-year scientific study, that's precisely the conclusion your agency came to. 

Nothing else matters in the argument about whether to put a mine in Bristol Bay and effectively turn it into a mining district than one simple question:  Is it worth the risk?  Those owning and operating the mine and their shareholders stand to make half a trillion dollars on the prospect.  If something goes wrong, as your watershed assessment concludes will likely happen eventually, EVERYONE else loses.  A 100 year mine is not an equitable trade for a thousands-years-old, sustainable salmon run that feeds the world and can continue in perpetuity if not disrupted or destroyed.

Please consider this risk intently when considering these comments.

Sincerely,

Mark Titus",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I am opposed to EPAs proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents.

We cannot allow the destruction of the Bristol Bay extensive estuary, upper bay, and feeding river systems. The mine would destroy one of the world's best sustainable fisheries, and the sustainable jobs it supports. The short term profiteering by the mining company will be a disaster for generations of Americans. It should not be allowed! EPA administrators are supposed to protect the environment, not enable its destruction!!  

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

The salmon are under numerous environmental threats - from microplastics in the Pacific, to changes of habitat upstream, to the ""blob"" an area of unusually hot water in the Pacific ocean over the last several years. The Pebble Mine would be the worst of these threats. In a mine of this size, in a watershed this permeable, catastrophic pollution is a question of when, not if. Alaska is a high earthquake area, the ground is permeable - the proposed containment efforts are doomed.

Sockeye salmon are the most vulnerable salmon species up stream. They reproduce in lakes far from the sea - the Kitoi hatchery personnel refer to them as ""prima donnas."" In the Gulkhana hatchery, hatchery personnel note that if you lightly bump a box of hatchery fish in the first few weeks, 90% of the fish will die. It is illegal to drive 4-wheelers through salmon streams as a result. 

The Pebble Mine is so much more invasive and destructive than a 4-wheeler! To support the Pebble Mine is to support a foreign entity (Pebble mine is wholly owned by Northern Dynasty, a Canadian company) over the lives and livelihoods of Alaskan - American - fishermen, their families and their communities. This is not a partisan issue: this is people's livelihoods, and the health and sustainability of one America's most important fisheries.

It is the Environmental Protection Agency's job -- it says so right in the name -- to protect the environment and save this region of Alaska - protect the Bristol Bay watershed from foreign corporations, and preserve this fishery and its fish habitat for this and future generations of Alaskans.

I'm writing in reference to Docket # EPA-HQ-ORD-2012-0276. Please prohibit the disposal of mine waste in Alaska's Bristol Bay watershed. This mine would be a huge detriment to the surrounding wildlife and subsequently those who live there. With so much of the world's sockeye salmon population reliant on this area, we would effectively be dooming the species to unnecessary extinction. And that is incredibly harmful, not just to the fish, but the ecosystem that they are apart of, an ecosystem that humans similarly rely on.

We need to work to preserve as much of our planet's natural beauty as we can, while we still can. Not just because it is sad to see such mass extinctions in so short a period of time, but because we are backing ourselves into a corner. We cannot live on a barren planet and that is where we are headed if we keep sacrificing natural environments for short term financial gain.  I urge the EPA to take immediate action to use existing provisions of the Clean Water Act to protect this large and irreplaceable wild salmon fishery. Please.

Sincerely,

The area is the largest spawning site in the world for Sockeye Salmon as nearly half the entire population spawns there. The Salmon are also a prime food source for other wildlife and people who live in the area. The Salmon industry  generates over 14,000 full and part time jobs per year which generates nearly $500 million annually. If the original mining plans for the Pebble Mine are approved and Northern Dynasty Minerals  is allowed to mine in Bristol Bay, the Sockeye Salmon habitat will be completely destroyed, causing thousands to be unemployed, massive financial losses and impact on a culture that has been dependent on the species for thousands of years. I question Scott Pruitt's decision to lift the protection of Bristol Bay without first consulting  the scientists and researches who have spent decades studying the area. The ecological value of Bristol Bay is very important to protect and if the EPA fails to deny a permit to Northern Dynasty Minerals, than I question if the current administration has the ability to protect any areas of ecological importance.

Each year we order salmon caught in Bristol Bay to enjoy all winter..a healthy addition to our diet that supports the local Alaskan fishing industry.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

The 2014 EPA decision was based on  listening to Alaskan businesses and citizens as well as over 1.5 million other Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs.

The proposed Pebble Mine is many order of magnitude larger than the former Howe Sound Mine in Chelan, Washington. Yet the ecological scar that the Howe Sound Mine left on the pristine mountain wilderness has persisted for fifty years and will require nearly a century of further care to restore balance to the environment.
Commercial fishing in Bristol Bay provides a vital source of income and sustenance for thousands. And while fishing is not necessarily an environmentally friendly operation it relies on a healthy ecosystem to be sustainable. The health of the Bristol Bay watershed is currently ensured in large part by the ADF&G.
Usage of headwaters for mining operations has the potential to not only disrupt a pristine ecosystem but the livelihoods of those who live and fish in the area.

And while I understand that the EPA's current director, Scott Purit, is actively attempting to rollback all regulations that purportedly hamper big business, instead of protecting health and the environment, I still must try my small part to make a difference in this world, even if I am only adding to the chorus of 300,000 other citizens of this great nation who understand that our greatness comes not from the coffers of multinationals but the livelihood of all individuals who wholeheartedly believe that we cannot be great unless we care for, preserve, and protect all diversity of life.

There was an extensive amount of input from the public, during meetings and public comment periods, and the response was overwhelmingly supportive. In addition, the EPA has noted that commercial fishing in Bristol Bay generates $300 million annually in direct sales of commercially caught salmon, generating 11,000 jobs. These salmon support not only the commercial and sportfishing industries, but a traditional Native way of life that has endured for millennia and thrives today. What will happen to these jobs, and the livelihood of all these people, if this watershed is destroyed? How can we ignore these findings now and reverse course? There may be a new administration in office, but none of the facts have changed! 

I also ask that if a final withdrawal decision is made following this comment period, I ask that the Administrator review and reconsider the withdrawal decision.

It is unthinkable that you would consider jeopardizing the livelihood and industry that Bristol Bay already supports for such an short-sighted economic and environmental disaster.  How about applying some REAL economics to this situation to understand how there is no economic support for destroying this natural resource?

The EPA should not withdraw the July 2014 determination to restrict dumping of mining wastes in the Bristol Bay watershed.

I do not understand why the federal agency created to protect the environment would propose action that would allow damage to a pristine watershed that sustains one of the world's most important fisheries.

EPA's peer-reviewed assessment found that unrestricted dumping of metal-containing mining wastes in the Bristol Bay watershed could potentially destroy salmon-supporting streams, ponds and wetlands, jeopardizing the fishery and the livelihood of thousands of Alaskans.

Thewatershed's ecological resources generated nearly $480 million in direct economic expenditures and sales and provided employment for over 14,000 full- and part-time workers in 2009.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC, EPA 910-R-14-001A-C, ES, 2014. Chapter 5.)

Contrary to comments by the backers of the Pebble Mine project, EPA's watershed assessment was scientifically based and thoroughly peer-reviewed, and the public has had an extensive opportunity to comment on it. The assessment and public comments received should be key components of any future action on this issue.

A majority of Alaska voters oppose mining development that would harm wild salmon within the fisheries preserve, as evidenced by voter approval of the 2014 state-wide ballot measure.  The measure was designed to give the legislature the power to prohibit mining projects in Bristol Bay if legislators determine the activity to be harmful to wild salmon within the fisheries reserve. [Source: Alaska Bristol Bay Mining Ban, Ballot Measure 4, 2014. https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Bristol_Bay_Mining_Ban,_Ballot_Measure_4_(2014).]  Also, the overwhelming majority of residents of Bristol Bay are opposed to the proposed Pebble Mine project.

Given the volatile market of global commodities, it is not a stretch to consider that over it's lifetime the Pebble Mine would be inoperative, waiting for more favorable market conditions to develop. Thus, the claimed economic benefits that the mine would bring to the state of Alaska would be temporary at best and completely absent at worst. To favor the industry with the ostensibly greater profit margins but no guarantee of success is a serious gamble that mortgages the livelihoods and health of the people who live around and depend on Bristol Bay. 

The economic and ecological reasons for not developing the mine are convincing, but it is the cultural element of this debate that is possibly the most persuasive argument of all. Alaska natives, whose livelihoods and way of life depend upon salmon, are facing a future where this lifestyle will no longer be possible. Given the importance of salmon to the native people, it seems ironic at best that the Pebble Partnership would argue that the people of the region will benefit from the project.

It is frustrating to me that EPA administrators directed the EPA to agree to initiate a proposed withdrawal process. Southwest Alaska is a magical place, acknowledged by the presence of national parks, national wildlife refuges, and national monuments in the area. The risk the dredge and fill material pose is not worth the short-term profits to be had. 

As an environmental protection scientist for water, this issue is very close to my professional focus. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to write scientifically about the many reasons this should not happen. I will take the time to list some of the major issues I see with the proposed withdrawal process. 

Salmon are a keystone species within this watershed. Their habitat and their wellbeing could easily be destroyed for generations if there were a  natural disaster which caused the release of dredge or fill material into the environment. Salmon are not only key to the health of that watershed's ecosystem, they are also key to the people who fish them for a living or subsistence. 

Environmental pollution from mining is long lasting and not easily cleaned up, especially in such a remote place. The dredge and fill material could pollute waterways and soil for generations. 

Withdrawing Clean Water Act Restrictions just sounds bad. I remember learning about the status of the environment in the country, which led to Congress writing and approving the Clean Water Act. The rivers were so polluted, they could catch fire. 

People live there. People live within this watershed. They recreate and harvest food in that watershed. By withdrawing the Clean Water Act restrictions, it is sending a message that those people don't matter. There is a long human history in that part of Alaska and it would be disrespectful to the people of the past, present, and future to destroy a landscape which was, is and will be their home. 

Protect the salmon, protect the environment, and protect the bush communities of Southwest Alaska from the catastrophe that could occur, if the EPA were to withdraw proposed Clean Water Act restrictions on mining Pebble Deposit. Do not withdraw the proposed Clean Water Act restrictions on mining Pebble Deposit. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Do it. Protect our environment. It is your job to be a steward, not a PIMP for corporate greed.

I am opposed to EPAs proposal to rescind the 2014 Proposed Determination designed to protect Bristol Bays world class fisheries. Please stand with American jobs and communities and preserve the Bristol Bay Proposed Determination.

Bristol Bay, Alaska, is one of America's last great wild salmon fisheries. Each year, tens of millions of wild salmon return, supporting upwards of 14,000 jobs in the commercial and sport fishing industries, and serving as a one-in-a-lifetime destination for anglers from around the world as well as the cultural cornerstone for the region's communities. These long-established businesses are at risk from a foreign-owned mining company that wants to build the proposed Pebble Mine, which is opposed by more than 65 percent of Alaskans and more than 80 percent of Bristol Bay residents. 

In 2014, led by Alaska Native Tribes, interests including commercial fishing business owners and sportsmen asked the EPA step in to ensure that this mine wouldn't jeopardize Bristol Bay. The EPA responded by listening to over 1.5 million Americans, hosting dozens of community meetings, reviewing Pebble's many detailed filings with state and federal agencies, and conducting a twice peer-reviewed scientific assessment of the potential impacts to the region. Withdrawing the proposed determination ignores the overwhelming majority of Alaskans and puts the short-term interests of a foreign mining company above thousands of local jobs. 

For the sake of our wildlife, waterways, and communities, I urge you to protect Bristol Bay and prevent this horrible open-pit mine from destroying one of our nation's most precious ecosystems.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"
